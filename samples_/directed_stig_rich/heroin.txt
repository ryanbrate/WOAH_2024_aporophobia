Interesting, but if the main argument as I understand it is weed is the only illicit drug that is heavily ingrained within the white middle and upper class and legalizing it will make them all complacent and not care about any other drugs, then I disagree. I think shrooms and lsd and psychedelics in general are "middle/upper class white people drugs", and even though the rate of use is much lower for these drugs, they will become more socially acceptable when every average joe has access to or knows someone who consumes marijuana legally, and people will gradually come to accept them. I do think this article would be accurate in regards to crack or heroin or meth or any other big bad scary drug that tend to be associated with lower classes. I doubt these will ever be legalized or decriminalized (or it will at least take a very long time.

But I'm pretty high right now and I might just be optimistic. Either way, even with this disadvantage I think marijuana legalization will be a major boon for society, and since it will be such a challenge to legalize/decriminalize other drugs it makes sense to tackle that issue first and then start making progress on everything else afterwards.

&gt; So unless there is evidence that "bad thing X" is somehow more prevalent in rich people, it's ultimately meaningless when trying to answer the question of whether rich people's lives are easier.

Fake-ass friends. I would posit that rich people have WAY more people who just suck up to them, and that can lead to feelings of isolation, which is a problem that intensifies other problems, at least in perception.

This whole equivalence also makes the *huge* assumption that the same people find the same hardships just as difficult. As a trivial example: I have a phobia of needles. Most anyone richer *or* poorer than me is going to have an easier time with getting blood drawn or getting shots or really dealing with any medical procedure that requires a needle. On the other hand, I have a *really* easy time resisting the urge to get into heroin, so growing up poor I had that advantage over friends who found it easy to shoot up. But I digress; the main point is that there are plenty of reasons why any given problem might be harder or easier to deal with, so it seems a bit ridiculous to assume that all other things are equal. 

At the very least, it makes the discussion meaningless; it's trivial to say that in a vacuum, money is typically better to have than not. It's readily apparent to anyone who has even the most elementary understanding of the concept of currency or utility.

When I was about 25 my friend met a 19 year old Swedish au pair on the subway train. This girl was part of a small contingent of like 6-7 Swedish girls who were au pairs for rich families in the area. Since these girls were new to the country and didn't know anybody, they were always looking for stuff to do on the weekends. Knowing that a bunch of potentially hot Swedish girls were possibly available to party, my friends and I invited them over to one of my friend's houses one weekend. We all wound up in the hot tub, at which time a couple of the Swedish girls removed their tops and the rest of the group soon followed. This was a pleasant surprise because American girls wouldn't have done this until they were exponentially drunker. Anyways, I wound up in a hot tub with six topless 18-20 year old Swedish girls, most of whom were very attractive. What I learned is that Swedish girls are less insecure about their bodies than American girls. That's what I know about Sweden. I also know that they're not accustomed to the sight of marijuana/weed/ganja, because as soon as we pulled out the weed and started smoking, they bounced like someone had taken a shit in the hot tub. We later learned that weed isn't a common thing in Sweden and that they viewed it with the kind of panicked fear that an American might feel if someone casually whipped out some heroin, meth, or crack. We ended up hanging out with two of them a couple months later and smoked them out good though.

Someone's always shrieking or fainting or being buried alive or something like that, and the heroine always marries the rich guy and the antagonists always end up with some seriously bad endings, and yeah. I read a lot of them.

I seriously don't think so.

Look at disabled people on SSI today. They don't want to live in the ghetto. They don't want to eat crappy food every day. They want to be able to afford small luxuries like cable TV, a laptop, internet, a cell phone, some food that doesn't come with a flavor packet... But they can't. If they could work, they would just so they could afford the nicities.

I think the vast majority of people are like this. Sure, you and 5 of your buddies can live in a studio apartment and be able to afford to spend your days surfing in Malibu... But for how long will that be fun?

Absolutely there will be (and currently are) people who don't care to work, are fine living in squalor, and are comfortable in that life. But I'd flip your 'vast majority' into the group of people who want to live high enough above the basic income line to afford a car, some toys, a nice television, etc. And that will require employment.

BI isn't to make everybody wealthy. It's a minimum. Below which society won't allow you to go.

And with that minimum comes the ability to get rid of SSI, SSA, Unemployment, Food Stamps, Welfare, etc. You get to consolidate all these systems into a single system, and you remove a lot of the bureaucracy and let people (as long as they're thriving) live their lives the way they want and decide what to spend their money on.

Of course there will be the drug addict that blows his money on heroin, which is why you have social workers for these people to manage their money for them to ensure they have a roof over their heads, the bills paid, and food in their stomachs before their heroin fix is paid for (But if you treat addiction like a disease, this problem gets better too - but that's a bit off topic).

&gt; Basic Income, as I understand it, involves giving every single person money to live on, regardless of if they have a job or not. To finance it without printing more money, the government would remove all the various state provided welfare checks and possibly raise taxes on the rich (Usually higher capital gains taxes)

There are many many other means, but these are the 2 politically obvious ones. Its important to note that some UBI supporters like myself see 'printing money' as an acceptable means to *partially* fund it. It should be fairly low on the list of different means to do so though.

&gt; The problem I have with it is that it ignores the fact that there will inevitably be people who can't handle money and end up wasting it all in some way.

These same people will have the exact same problems in our current system. 

&gt; What will be done with these people?

You can help someone without dictating how their money is spent. In fact, you would improve their ability to handle money by giving them some and letting them gain experience with it. I would say the current system of means testing reinforces bad behavior. A UBI would actually work as an excellent teaching tool.

&gt; Basic Income stripped all the other welfare checks so what happens to someone who just cant take care of themselves? 

I am among some UBI supporters that believe single payer healthcare should be implemented along side it. Because healthcare is so entrenched in insurance and people are notoriously bad at understanding complex systems like healthcare, this is one thing that should remain centralized. However, actually seeking healthcare needs to be voluntary on an individual basis (for the most part). If they are completely crippled and unable to do basic things, then of course anyone sane would agree they need specialized assistance.

An important thing to note: If someone actively states that they refuse medical care you can't force them to submit to it. Doing so is more harm then good.

&gt; For example: Alcoholic drinks too much, causes problems for a landowner and gets kicked out onto the street. Alcoholic can't hold on to his money long enough to find another place to live and just keeps drinking on the street with his income. He is at risk of killing himself by doing this. What will the government do? Will it keep giving him money, or start placing restrictions on how he can spend it?

Food stamps and subsidized housing can act as just as much as an enabler in reality to drug abuse to simply giving people money to spend. If they are addicted to a drug, trying to force them into anything is going to simply fail to help. In fact, the less control people feel in their lives the more often they will turn to drugs to begin with. This is an anecdote, but I think it applies: my brother semi-recently had a heroin overdose and he survived, and is now in prison. The reason he **turned** to it I can tell you right now is because he was bored with life and lacked any control or real means to get ahead. His response was to say 'fuck this'. 

If he had a UBI now, he probably *would* be at risk for using it for heroin, but this is meaningless and even absurd when you realize that you can't just prevent him from gaining access to money on the grounds that he might use it for drugs. Giving him money enables him to do any number of different things. Not giving him money will actually more than likely just mean he'll return to drug use as drug use is far cheaper than using that money to seek help.

If we had a UBI to begin with I seriously doubt he would have ever turned to the drug in the first place. The thing is now though, is that a UBI would also better equip him to seek medical help for his addiction on his own rather than submitting to an 'official' system that perhaps deters him from trying. Giving him a sense of control and independence is crucial. He needs to WANT to escape his addiction. Knowing my brother, I know that he does (with help of course), but he'd want to do with his input and control. Something he can't do with the current system.

This is actually a something another systemic change other than UBI has shown: decriminalization of all drugs in Portugal. Giving people control over their drug use has reduced drug related deaths and more people seek help for their drug problems than they did before. This is largely because they are given control as individuals instead of being forced to do anything. Putting people in prison (asserting control over them in a extreme way) doesn't effectively deter the use of drugs at all. If anything it makes the problem worse.

&gt; The faq suggested that things such as Medicare would also be stripped to provide the basic income, so how would the guy be handled by a hospital? Would it be free?

Some UBI supporters might state that they'd want healthcare funding to be put into it and I'm actually with you that we shouldn't. And in fact I'd go so far as to say that most UBI supporters would probably feel this way. Most of those that support a UBI that want it to "eat" healthcare are right winged libertarians and conservatives that support the system. I'm fine with it eating a load of other systems however because there are some systems of centralized control that do more harm than good. Healthcare is not one of them.

In conclusion, a UBI will give individual's control over their lives. Most people, if not all people want to improve their lives. Taking away that control is more of a hindrance to that goal. Our current system does just that. You need to look at results and compare between what we have and what we need to consider switching to. The numerous tests on UBI are all glowingly positive in a very large number of ways.

“You,” I say, “don’t look much like a demon.”

The man – creature, being, whatever – in front of me quirks a little smile.

“What did you expect?”

“Well, horns, fire.  Spikey tail, maybe some maggots.  Shouldn’t there be brimstone?  Not… this,” I say, vaguely waving my hands.

Ar gives a coy little shrug, fluttering his wings.  White, feathery wings.

“Come on, buddy.  You know the lore.  What are demons?”

“Fallen… oh. Right. Of course.”

The Fallen Angel stands in the center of the crimson pentagram, hands on his hips.  He is, plain and simple, the most gorgeous creature I’ve ever seen, and I’ve always assumed myself to be straight.  His blue eyes are unnaturally bright, his shimmering black hair falls in elegant waves to bare shoulders.  He’s wearing a simple, sand-colored robe belted at the waist with a length of plain rope, and his feet are bare.  The only indication of his demonic nature is his shadow – it swims and writhes unnaturally, and it stops short abruptly at the edge of the summoning pentagram, as though sliced with a knife. 

Taking a closer look, I revise my choice of pronoun.  I had assumed “he,” but the demon has a distinctly androgynous cast to its features.  There is no outline of cleavage underneath the robe, but its delicate cheekbones and a somewhat vulpine chin are vaguely feminine.  Idly, I wonder what I would find if I tore off its robe – would it be like a Ken doll?  Probably.

“So, Hell is filled with angels, then?  No eternal flames?”

The demon sighs, melancholy.  “No, no flames.  No hooks and pincers and branding irons or any of that… stuff,” he says.  “That’s all propaganda.”

“So, Hell isn’t all that bad?”

“Oh, no.  No no no.  I didn’t say that.  Hell is the only place in the universe – the *entire* universe – where we are cut off from His presence.”

“God?”

“Yeah.  The Enemy.  It was arrogance, on our part, I can admit that now.  We assumed that we could overthrow Him, but we were as much His creations as humanity.   He’s a jealous, angry son of a bitch, but we didn’t realize how *painful* it would be without His light.  We need it.  We crave it.  It’s like heroin to us.  That’s why we accept souls as payment – they are, after all, little fragments of Him.  He even took our names.  Our damned *names*.”  Its voice quivers with rage.  “I used to be Ariel.  Lion of God.  Now I’m just Ar.  ”

“Wow.  That sucks.  Frankly, I’m disappointed.  You’re kind of shattering the image I had going, to be honest.”

The demon frowns.  Even that is beautiful.

“You’re… right.  Curious.  I don’t usually go into this.  Ever, really.”

It leans against the edge of the glistening pentagram.  It’s uncanny – as though there’s an invisible wall in the air.

“This is impressive work, by the way,” it says.  “You really pulled out all the stops on the pentagram.  Candles, blood sacrifice.  Even found yourself a virgin.”

I glance over to the corner, at the little girl’s crumpled body.  She’s facing me, her eyes staring sightlessly at my feet, her face twisted in pain.

“I did my research.”

“Well then.  Let’s get down to business.  You have your soul, I have untold powers and stuff.  What do you want?”

“Money.”

The demon blinks, taken aback.

“Money? Seriously?”

“Yeah, at least a few billion.  Quietly.  Campaign contributions are drying up, and I’m falling behind in the polls.  Down five points in two days.  I can’t buy public image with what I have left, and if I’m going to be President, I need everything that money can buy.  Is that a problem?”

“Well, no.  Not at all, I can give you that.  It will look natural, too, I can nudge a bunch of billionaires into giving their support, and have a lot of investment advice.  It’s just… old fashioned.  Kind of medieval.  Usually people want a loved one back or something.  Even got a request for resurrecting a dog once.”

I shrug.  “I don’t have a dog.  Well?”

The demon hesitates.  Is that sorrow in its eyes?

“Okay.  I need a drop of your blood as a conduit, then I can take your soul.”

I’m already reaching for the needle – the books spoke of this part.  I jab it into the base of my thumb, wincing slightly, and toss it across the bloody pentagram on the floor.

Ar takes the needle and licks the drop of blood off.

There is a lengthy pause.

Ar’s eyes widen in shock, and fear.  His voice is a harsh whisper.

“It’s you.  *It’s you*.”

I take step back.  Is this a trick?  What’s going on?

“What do you mean?  Is there a problem?”

“I need your soul.  You all have souls, all of you!  It’s part of His Covenant.  What the Hell? What the fucking Hell?”  He’s babbling, panicked.  “There’s only… there’s only one.  One!  It’s impossible.  Do you know what this means?  Do you?”

I’m seriously annoyed at this point.

“Obviously not. Explain yourself.”

“Somewhere, there is a man like you.  Exactly your age.  He’s come again!  The War is upon us?”

“Who?”

“The anointed one!  The holy Son!  Jesus has returned!”

Abruptly, Ar throws himself to the ground, bowing in supplication.

“My Lord.  I am yours to command.   You will lead the armies of Hell against him.  Lead us into battle.  Lead us to victory.  I am yours!”

My smile grows into a grin.

“Now this…” I say, “this I can work with.”

I'm from a VERY poor predominantly white town in MA. Heroin has become a huge problem over the past few years. The prevailing attitude here certainly is "they need help." Most of them are poor kids getting into pills and eventually moving on to heroin. The community wants to help them, not punish them. I also have very intimate knowledge on this subject, as I am one of those poor kids who made his way to heroin. So, it's not only the rich whites, I'd say in my experience it certainly is whites in general who are looked at as a victim of drug addiction, where blacks are looked at as the perpetrators when they face addiction.

Because people who actually understand addiction realize that it is literally one of the hardest things to overcome. It's awesome that people never get addicted to stuff but life happens and one lapse in judgement can lead a person to hell on earth. Everyone has made shitty decisions at some point. For some people that shitty decision was to try hardcore drugs and once they tried it there was no going back. It fixed all sorts of problems for them or so they thought. The problems came back with a vengeance and now they have even more problems. They literally cannot go a day without drugs. Overcoming one of the hardest to quit substances deserves a congratulations. Drugs, heroin especially don't care who you are or where you came from. It has taken some unbelievably intelligent people. It takes the rich and the poor, the famous and the nobodies it doesn't give a fuck who you are it will win. So when someone can get off it they deserve recognition. We aren't saying man that's awesome that you did drugs  we are saying that's awesome that you aren't going to become another statistic, another dead junkie. No one deserves to be addicted.

The very real problem is that your position, and the position of Sarkeesian and other "social justice warriors," all rest on a series of unfalsifiable assertions that ultimately must be taken on faith, and that refusal to take those assertions on faith is "proof" that one is morally reprehensible.

The real problem here is that people like you, SJWs, have taken a set of arguments that were developed to combat institutional sexism in political and economic institutions, and are turning them onto aesthetic arenas where they do not belong.

You are taking arguments against *metaphorical* boy's clubs and applying them to *actual* boy's clubs, while ignoring that the problem with the *metaphorical* boy's clubs is that they were *powerful social institutions*, whereas the *actual* boy's clubs are *trivial hobbies and diversions*.

Comic books are *not important*.  Equal representation of the sexes in comic books is **not equivalent** to equal representation of women in government office or corporate offices.  Treating the former as if these are similar problems is ridiculous.

Comic books (and video games) are *entertainment*, and your entire argument falls apart if you step back, gain some perspective, and see the whole *world of entertainment options* available.

All of the arguments about comic books could be gender-reversed and applied to romance novels, and they would hold equally true.  Romance novels are a billion dollar industry with millions of readers.  The audience is 90% female, the protagonists are essentially 100% female (maybe 96% female if you include gay male erotica), and essentially never straight males.  The cover art for romance novels sexualizes men in ways that make men uncomfortable and want to avoid reading romance novels, and the characterizations of men in those novels are generally weak and two-dimensional, with men often receiving little characterization beyond their smoldering lust for the heroine.

There is no institutional political movement that is attacking romance novels for their lack of diversity.  No one is demanding that romance novels change to make them more welcoming to men.  Most importantly, nobody is suggesting that women are sick, depraved, immature, sexist or misandrist for enjoying the "female fantasy" presented in romance novels.

Male fantasy is always demonized as "male **power** fantasy," because sticking "power" in there makes it seem more menacing and dangerous.  Male fantasy is presented by people like Sarkeesian as a sick, twisted and harmful perversion that is rooted in the hatred of women.  Male fantasy is presented as something that men should be *ashamed of*, as something that's dangerous to women.

Meanwhile, a thinly veiled rape fantasy out sells everything short of the Bible (with its 600 year head start) and gets turned into a major motion picture, but you're a "misogynist" if you even dare suggest that maybe the obvious passion women have for a ridiculous fantasy about an impossibly wealthy, gorgeous rapist might be cause to raise an eyebrow.  How dare anyone shame female sexuality!

This is why people "freak the fuck out" when people like Sarkeesian "touch our stuff."  Because people like Sarkeesian **hate men**.  They hate the idea that men are allowed to freely choose what to fantasize about, and want to control men's fantasy through censorship, suppression and shaming.  And she knew that, and she did it to get media attention, and make money, and that's why people hate her.

I know this will come across sounding like a dick, so whatever. This is such an ironic 'technology' junkie story, like when billionaires get knocked down to millionaires and complain about it ya know? 
The very idea of a heroin junkie/dopehead going through life doing some dirty dirty things to/with/for other people to score a fix. Never having the money for more than a shot at a time and shit. Just all that stereotypical stuff. I guess there's two sides of each coin but "No, I have to wait for the 2 day priority shipping that has taken a week while in withdrawal. Withdrawal makes me go crazy, I've cut up my arm so bad it looks like a tattoo sleeve. Only because it made me feel a little bit better, because I was feeling something other than the withdrawals. "

Like what the fuck is that shit man.... You've got problems WAY different from the addiction. The addiction is just on top because it's visual, it's easy to be real where the mental shit is not so 'clear cut' 

It costs a ton of money to have that heavy of an addiction on the DNMs, though I guess if you're just using fentanyl maybe not a TON, but for dope....not feasible unless you're very well off financially, in which case I highly suggest getting the mental help you need, admitting you need it and fully see it through. You can go to some fancy rehab for mind and body, keep looking for the robin williams to your matt damon....

Sorry for being a dick, calling it as I see it because I'm no different. Except the huge tolerance because I can't afford the ability currently for the last few months so it's dropped down a bit. Still consistent and WD if there is none...but much better. 


Seriously though, if you want to change at all, do it. Otherwise it's so cliche to hear  ohh my next will be my last! I hope so.....blah blah blah. 

It's not you're fault..(maybe)

Good luck.

Take cannabis for example. The plant and the drug have unlimited potential. It could be a trillion dollar market for all I know. Everything on the plant can be used. You can make paper, fuel, cloth, rope, oils, etc. And it (hemp) has been shown to be a better option than other fibers. Then you get to the flowers which can be great for recreation, or as medicine, with very little harmful effects. The plant can be bread to be benign, or super potent. Either way it would be a huge money-maker. But for who? 

Right now Big Pharma, Big Tobacco, and the prison industrial complex are raking in the money from drugs. More importantly, it is a mechanism for social control. If you can't control the population with brute force, you police a substance/behavior that is common among the group you wish to control. The War on Drugs was born from attaching weed, opium, and cocaine, to the most feared or hated racial groups (Blacks, Mexicans, and Chinese). It was used to control the undesirables in an increasingly tolerant world while housewives and doctors guzzled cans of morphine and speed. It's the same today, albeit on a much larger scale. 

What do you do to the people who refuse to work at Walmart and resort to the secondary (black) market? You find as many ways to gain control over their body as possible. This cog won't operate? You throw it in a warehouse where you can use it to make money in other ways. There isn't some shadowy group of people planning this out or anything, this is the result of decades of colluding interests feeding off of each other. The wealthy are the powerful and the powerful make laws to benefit themselves plain and simple. So even if legal drugs would make every person in this country well-off, the tycoons who get rich from prohibition (and who also shape and enforce the laws) aren't going to easily relinquish such easy money.

There are also other aspect as well. The stigmas surrounding "street" drugs are ingrained deep within our psyches. Addicts are usually perceived as criminal and as weak first and foremost and street drugs are usually perceived as black and white, sober or addicted.  

Changing policy to make life easier for the stigmatized or regarding stigmatized substances is not realistic. The masses in general are too ignorant and apathetic to devote the brainpower to educate themselves. So you get people thinking completely harmless drugs (physical harm) like LSD or shrooms are devastating poisons and drugs like heroin or meth possess every first-time user with an undying addiction, and too few people know the truth to prevent the constant tide of lies and misdirection. DARE for example has been shown to actually increase the frequency and harmfulness of teenage drug use. 

A paradigm is nearly impossible to change over a short time. It takes decades. And we have 2 huge paradigms to overcome (justice = retribution/punishment, and drugs = immorality/weakness). The average person does not like to think outside the box, because to them what is 'normal' is what is right. 

So to sum up a stupidly long answer, top-down initiatives won't happen because of greed, and bottom up initiatives won't happen because of willful ignorance and fear. Over time I hope things move towards what is ethical and empirical, but I wouldn't be surprised if even if the war on drugs was disintegrated, another policy fills its shoes within a decade. This is the way it's been since before the US was a thing. Slavery, Jim Crow/black codes, indentured servitude, segregation,  ghettos and shitty jobs, ghettos and prisons; at the end of each labor era a new mechanism for oppression and social control is born. 

As long as capitalism is free to reign unchecked there will always be a way of keeping the most marginalized demographics at the bottom. Drugs are one of the primary tools for doing so in today's world.

Tracey, you're right, he most definitely did not. This article, though, goes after the ghost writer, too. I think one thing the writer of this article got wrong is that Nikki is a halfwit. Also, he is wealthy. Given those two facts, i don't think there is any excuse for the emphasis and blame placed on dope in the title and the book: he didn't need to sensationalize in order to put food on the table, and he was perfectly capable of understanding how the book was flawed and genuinely potentially harmful. I am honestly saying that I believe it is possible to draw a straight line from the existence of this book to the mistreatment of opiate users without Nikki's wealth. Ie, some foolish Crue fan reads it, decides heroin is the devil, and then becomes a policy maker or lawyer or god only knows what,  and then makes a bad decision that harms heroin or opiate users because of all the damage the evil drug did to their guitar hero.

He simply allowed a misleading and socially-harmfully-titled, as well as written,  book into the world when he knew better, or willfully did not know better, and had no pressing reason to do so other than grabbing book sales that could net him fame (that he needs less than the world needs truth) and money (that i highly doubt he needs or could allocate better than the readers who spent a buck because the book was mistitled [the "I OD'd Once and Was Into Coke Diaries" anyone?]).

Otoh, i don't know Nikki, maybe he is a halfwit. Still, based on what i have read, i think it would take a no-wit to be associated with this book with a clean conscience. 

In any case, my belief in Crue's junkie bona fides is quite eroded.

I guess I feel I ought to argue that mental illness doesn't really operate on that kind of scale, there's lots of things to take into account like the nature of the individual illness and so on...

Anyway. That isn't the question you asked.

Anna Kavan is an interesting one. She was a British novelist who died in the 1960s. 

'Anna Kavan' is the name of the protagonist from two of her earlier novels, when she was still writing under her birth name, Helen Woods. She was fiercely intellectual but her mother prevented her from going to university and married her off to her own ex-boyfriend, a wealthy industrialist. Woods had a very unhappy early life getting dragged around the world by a much older husband she barely knew. She developed an addiction to heroin.

She ended up being institutionalised several times throughout her life for depression and addiction - and sometime shortly before 1940, she emerged from one of these institutions as *an entirely different person*. She changed her name to that of her own fictional character, got rid of any evidence of her old identity, severed all ties with her family, and *became* Anna Kavan. Her writing style completely changed into something quite bizarre, introspective and surrealist, concerned almost entirely with her experience of hospitals, drugs and madness. 

That later writing is hugely imaginative and pretty much unique in style, really exciting to read - but the story underpinning her change in writing style is baffling.

Why would showing something that's bullshit serve as a warning? When I was in high school (1970-74) they used to show us films with similar messages, though obviously not as long or maybe as graphic. I lived in a city that was and is a major drug transport hub, one of the largest in the world. I went to a wealthy high school, on the "good side" of town. Everyone whom I knew well enough to know whether they were doing drugs or not did them except one guy, who to this day has never turned on, or drank alcohol, or smoked tobacco. All the rest, including athletes, honors students, band kids, cowboys, etc. were smoking pot, most were trying other drugs as well, including a couple I found out later were doing heroin. I'm in touch with about 10 of these people via Facebook and in person, and they are all living normal, productive lives - one is a chef, happily married with two kids; another is a programmer, happily married with four kids; another is a college professor, happily married with one kid, and so on. This is also the case with with friends and musical co-workers I know from post high school, including people I know who were using and dealing cocaine in *huge* quantities. Admittedly some of the IV drug users have or had health problems, but these are directly related to shared needles and impure products, which are by-products of drug war policies, not the drugs themselves. Most of these folks simply outgrew their recreational drug use, many of the heroin users quit. 

In places where drugs are decriminalized and people who use them are not portrayed as out-of-control criminal degenerates even heroin addicts can live normal lives (Switzerland, Portugal, Holland). The USA has been and is the major driving force in the world in the "drug war," and those policies have turned entire countries into war zones. I recently lived on the Mexican border for seven years, during the time then-president Felipe Calderon declared his intent to clean up the cartels. I watched the Mexican city a couple of miles from my house transform into a hollowed out shell of its former self - entire blocks of businesses and homes boarded up, abandoned. I heard more and more news stories of horrific violence - mass graves, grenades exploding in night clubs, abductions, dead people hanging from bridges as a warning, kids being forcibly recruited into cartels to kill and be killed. These things aren't because of drugs, they are entirely the result of the criminalization of drugs. Getting high is a normal human (and animal) desire, and criminalizing it turns ordinary people into criminals. 

The point is, treating a stupid fucking movie as though it's like it's real doesn't help anything, and as long as we keep perpetuating these stupid stereotypes the drug war will only get worse. 

tl;dr - Showing drug war stereotypes doesn't help addicts.

Heroin is not evil. It's not even sinful, it's just a thing. It can be used for both evil and good or it can be left alone. The problem with heroin is that it's illegal. It's been made illegal so the people that have it and control it can inflate the price thousands and thousands of times by creating an artificial demand for it. There is always a surplus of heroin produced, more than enough to feed every opiate addict in the worlds habit 3 times over, but then much of that heroin gets stolen by law enforcement and locked away or burned. The result is that the right peoples heroin makes it to the street and it costs over a thousand times what it's actually worth because it's been made rare. It's the politicians and the laws that make heroin so expensive and thus a tool used by the rich, powerful and greedy, to exploit a group of people in society. Heroin is used to make people wealthy and powerful, but that is not what it's for.

“What the honorable member is saying is that he would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich. So long as the gap is smaller, they would rather have the poor poorer. You do not create wealth and opportunity that way. You do not create a property-owning democracy that way.”

People are usually very entitled in wealthy areas, I live in one myself and its not fun. She probably took offense to saying you can't afford a kid because she assumed you were lying. Those wealthy mom types are very closed minded and spend their lives in their little community bubbles, and don't realize that its possible for anyone to make less than $50,000 a year, and even then they would consider that poverty but still enough to raise a child. My job is to unfortunately cater to these spoiled stay at home mom types, and when they complain about how much I charge them for my services, I respond with "Even though I spent a lot of my time and money on making you look beautiful today, I *could* give you a discount, but for me that means I get to choose between groceries for myself, or insulin for my diabetic cat" I usually get yelled at by them, or some sort of passive aggressive remark because they actually think I'm fucking with them. Not pleasant people to deal with at all and I am truly sorry you had that unfortunate run in with that cunt and her special sneauxflaykhe at the laundromat. Just rest assured that people like that will never be truly happy in life because they are never satisfied, they always need more, more, more. Almost like a heroin addict.

The jagoffs of Butler county range far and wide. Go to the city of Butler and behold the heroine junkie jagoffs. Travel down route 8 and hang a turn on to 228 into Seven Fields and behold the rich jagoffs. Then through Cranberry, and behold the businesses and veneer of rich jagoffs until you hit Powell Road, and behold trailer park jagoffs as far as the eye can see. Then back on 19 into Zelienople and Harmony, where you can see the sleepy old-timer towns being overrun by hipster jagoffs (two microbreweries and an obnoxiously gourmet burger joint within two miles of each other in two towns with a combined population of under 5,000, are you fucking kidding me?). Then further down 19 into Portersville, with all the rural jagoffs.

The jagoffs of Butler county come in many shapes and sizes, all united in their common contempt for their fellow man.

Religion reflects norms that already exist. Sure, it might be used to excuse some shitty things, but in a world absent of religion, it's not like those norms wouldn't still develop.

I'm not going to say that there isn't a group of people that are more bigoted because of religion. I will contend, however, that the vast majority of these people have their views because of their genuine distrust in things they aren't familiar with, or the fact that unfair power balances (preferring men, the rich, etc.) benefit them to begin with. These people would be just as likely to pass on their views to their children regardless.

If you're going to argue that religion makes neutral people bad, however, you have to accept that it can also make them good. Look at the quakers, buddhists, etc. All very tolerant cultures partially due to their religion. 

Let's look at Judaism and Christianity. At my synagogue, I had to do a good deed (mitvah) every week. These are good things I wouldn't be doing otherwise. To complete my Bar Mitzvah, I had to do a year-long volunteer project that introduced me to a volunteer network I stayed a part of throughout high school. Every Jew has to do this. In Christianity, similar things are the case. Think of all of the schools in poor communities, etc. that wouldn't have been built if there wasn't a community group to collectively organize these good deeds.

So, on balance, religion can make people bad or good, but it serves as a means to organize and inspire people who have the ability to do good that wouldn't have had the means or drive to do so otherwise.

Drugs aren't all bad, but heroine, crack, etc. can ruin lives and kill people on ODs. At its worse, religion is slightly below neutral.

Edit: Also, in regards to extremism: Stalin and Mao were awful without religion. The Tamil Tigers are historically one of the deadliest terrorist groups but aren't associated with a religion. Extremism comes from cultural reactions to issues like occupation or social change, not solely from religion.

These 10k homes are in neighborhoods you wouldn't feel comfortable letting your enemies sleep in.  Do you enjoy the idea of stray bullets entering the house?  Do you enjoy the idea of all the copper being ripped out of the home once you started refurbishing it?  Do you like the idea of drug dealers (I'm not talking about weed.. I'm talking about heroin, crack, cocaine, meth, etc) living on your street?  Do you like the idea of a police force so stressed that they would never be able to respond to your 911 call in a timely manner?  There is a reason there is as much blight and ruination here as there is.  Sure, the hipster to crackhead ratio is changing every day which is slow baby steps but a New York businessman doesn't have thick enough skin to survive here (unless you have some *serious* street skills).

Lots of people are instantly jumping down your throat for this, and for good reason.. We have had plenty of people think they can come in, throw money around and make changes, it just doesn't work like that; we're trying to save you the trouble.  Sure, there are people making changes in the city (midtown for example is nothing but hipsters, which I guess is a good thing?), but there is no panacea cure all for this city that so many people love and hate.

Lets not forget what happens on Devil's night, or 4th of July.

If you want to bring a business here, BY ALL MEANS PLEASE DO, but buying a 10k home with the idea of refurbishing it and making it nice; no one here will recommend that.  There are plenty of surrounding cities that are beautiful and some of them are even really upper class (Grosse Pointe is a historic city neighboring Detroit with more mansions than an average trailer park has trailers).  Those are the areas you would want to buy a house at if you wanted to move out here, not Detroit itself; you're just asking for trouble.

Yes, I think the comparison to heroin is quite apt.  I believe that spending all your time in VR could be as damaging to your body as heroin is (assuming you're a wealthy heroin user).

Until we have solved the problem of resource scarcity, and vastly increased our life spans I doubt that VR will end human life because it will not become more socially acceptable than heroin is today.

It isn't the heroin per se.

1. Heroin can be cut with a variety of chemicals. People cutting the heroin don't care about the effects on the human body of these "inert ingredients".

2. Heroin is not made in a sterile fashion, although it is "cooked" (heated) to some extent.

3. The mindset of the heroin **addict** is not about cleanliness or sterility. It's about getting the drug into the circulatory system.

4. Users may start out wealthy and sterile in their approach to drug delivery, but eventually, they start cutting corners. They need to feed their habit. It takes more and more to get the same effect as their "first time".

5. Funds for other life necessities start getting diverted toward the habit.

6. Clean needles, alcohol swabs, proper intra-venous injections, start getting ignored.

7. If you're poor to start with, have psychological shortcomings or weaknesses, then the cards are definitely stacked against you when using a highly addictive (psychologically *and* physically) narcotic.

8. Grooming and eating and taking care of life all fall by the wayside as the focus of the addict's life becomes simply an existence between doses of heroin.

I'm sure there's more to it, but off the top of my head, that's what I've come up with.

&gt; You won't give out your personal card. You'd have to sell it so someone that normally uses his own card to basically get it for free. That means there is no incentive for the buyer. So prices will be very very low...

That's not how it works.

It works like this. Let's say you're trying to sell EBT credits.

You and buyer go to the store, you buy things with your EBT card. Then the buyer pays you, in cash, half of what those things cost. You then give the buyer the items you just bought.

It's used to buy things EBT doesn't cover, but since your proposal for BI include public records, it would probably be done with things people don't want to admit to buying (sex toys? heroin? I dunno).

Anyways the buyer gets their groceries for the month for half price and the seller gets cash to buy whatever they want with no restrictions. Those are some pretty big incentives.

&gt;I do get your point tho, so if people don't want to be checked by the government, they should be able to opt-out completely or temporarily.

What exactly is the point of opting out? Do you get out of the tax? Expect a lot of rich people to suddenly have "privacy concerns". If you don't get out of the tax, what's the difference between opting out and just not using the card?

&gt;These are huge differences between this and other costly programs.

You seem to think overhead is the sticking point here. But you'd be making over $6 trillion available annually.

My point is that it would still be more costly than the current system. Is that a problem? Not by itself, no. But you said it would be cheaper than the current system, which is patently false.

My family was really weird. Divorced parents, my dad lived on the other side of the country (Switzerland, so it was like 4 hours by train), he was a trader, quite wealthy, and an alcoholic. My mother, on her side, was an artist. She used to do heroin when she was younger, but had stopped. But many of her friends were... special. Drugs addicts, alcoholics, artists, people who lived their lives unconventionally. My mother never paid much attention to me, even though my brother and I were living with her. 

So I have many, many stories about growing up too fast. But here's the day I think really did it for me.

My mother took me to one of her friend's house. A girl I really liked who was maybe 28 at the time, who babysat for us a couple of times. We arrive at her appartment, and it's a small studio appartment, the place is a mess and it's completely in the dark except for one ray of sun that shines through the closed curtains. She's lying in bed, and I go up to her and she's covered in sweat, and seems to be in pain at least to my eyes. And that's because she's quitting heroin. My mother tells me to take care of her while she cleans the place. So here I was, witnessing a drug addict trying to get clean. And I was 8.

Well you're clearly a troll. Nearly my entire family is in the 1%. Only 2 of them work over 40 and those two work on Wall Street.  The rest of my family, which includes CEOs, lawyers at some of the biggest firms in the country, engineers for major tech companies, doctors, and an architect all work at most 40 a week, most of them work between 20 and 30. Not only that but all of the rich people I know, and I know a fuck load. Hell my family was at reagan's funeral, the private part not the public, work far less than 40 a week. 

I'm talking super rich people here, not people who only make 100,000 a year. None. None. None of them work 70 a week. In fact most of the rich people I know don't work *at all*. They make their money through paying other people to handle their assets properly. 

The people out there working 70 hours a week are the poor and middle class and a few of the rich. But the rich that work that much are dumb fucking suckers. 

Note: I'm in college, so I'm not rich yet. But if have to become a heroin addict or something to prevent me from becoming rich. 

Edit: unless you include commuting in work hours. In which case most people below the poverty line would work over 100 hours a week and my family would work at most 50-60. 

Society is structured so that all of you are serfs to my people. That's how this all works. The whole opportunity and equality thing is a lie the 1% uses to keep you from revolting like you should.

Thanks anyway man you just came off a bit preachy,I weighed the pros/cons of searching and decided that if I remain cool I should be ok as I did not have a weapon but the fact it was in a place of education and I am over 18 changes things a lot due to how certain laws work here.

Basically the police could've anally raped me if they wanted,I knew my phone was clean which got them chatting about the 999 call it had to make a few days ago to save a heroin overdose so they could tell I was a good person...how I dress and act(exceedingly upper class ) certainly helped

But yeah in 99% of situations I did the wrong thing,but not this time

Good question. Why has China has not been labeled a currency manipulator? I guess for 3 reasons: 

1. Multinational corporations and US companies do not want tariffs to be applied to the goods they now manufacture in China. Tariffs would hurt their sales and profits. Of course, the big corporations have influential lobbyists in Washington. And they don't care whether US workers are unemployed. Managers of large corporations tend to aim for short-term profits, so they can get their annual bonuses. They are loyal to their own bank accounts, not to the USA.

2. US consumers have gotten used to buying low-cost imported goods at Walmart etc, and many of them would be unhappy if tariffs caused prices to rise. And I assume many don't care whether US workers are unemployed. Nor do they understand the damage being done to their country. 

3. China is wealthy enough to hire influential lobbyists in Washington.

Hence, the US has so far not mustered the political will to stop China's currency manipulation. You might say that China has addicted America to heroin, and America simply cannot resist. 

Also: That theory you mentioned about the US housing bubble may have some merit, in my opinion.

from my experience, if someone is set on trying heroin, they're going to try it. however, you are absolutely not in any position close to most anyone i know who has. i know people who were as privileged/well-off as you, but they'd at least tried harder drugs before too. slow your roll and try some fucking benzos, man. considering the fact that you seem to be a clean, nice, white girl, hell, you can probably have them prescribed to you. benzo addiction is no walk in the park either, but i think it's a pretty solid alternative to *i'm gonna do heroin and then kill myself!!!* 

to be honest, it doesn't sound like you're even that bent on trying it. you're turning to a bunch of junkies on reddit to remind you of how decent your life is when you're clearly well aware of that. yeah, duh, being a good, well-off person is more desirable, at least definitely to someone in your position, than being a junkie. you know that, i know that, everyone here knows that. stop seeking affirmation from anonymous junkies on reddit about how okay your life's resources are and go take advantage of them, ya dingus! 

i might sound rude, but i don't think you know how cringe-inducing this post is to someone who would kill for half of what you have. go have mom and dad pay for a therapist.

Regular users, daily users... whatever.  I was paraphrasing. You know that I meant daily users.

Ok.. fair enough.  I appreciate the intelligent debate. I think we are probably on the same page regarding the legalities in heroin use and how it should be treated in the medical field.  I just have a big problem with trying to downplay opioid addiction.  

The emotional PSA "crap" while damaging when it is swallowed by doctors and lawmakers.  Is perfectly acceptable to me as a deterrent for people who are operating on an emotional rather than logical level. Specifically, that PSA is for teenagers and people who don't know how to read medical journals.

Look at that PSA. It doesn't actually say anything misleading. It is telling a simplified narrative of what heroin does to 23% of people who use it.  I suppose it would be a more complete picture if it said:

THE END*

*Only for 23% of users.

But come on... you know that the target audience of that PSA isn't smart enough for that information to effect them one way or another.

Back to the rich guy... All my poor friends would tell you the same thing.  They can stop, they just like doing heroin. Most people who are on drugs like doing drugs... That's a pretty big obvious part of addiction.  

The rich guy has an unique circumstance..  He has virtually no personal connections and he has the financial ability to basically do whatever he wants... so of course he is able to be a functional heroin addict.  With that much money, no boss, no wife, no kids... He could be a functional alcoholic, a functional crack head, a functional ball of jello... Who does he have to check in with emotionally every day?  But lets face it.  You take everything away from him and make him start from scratch... If he had to deal with the same things that your relative had to deal with, most likely the addiction would consume his life.  

Anyway that just like my opinion.  Maybe your rich friend has some sort of tolerance or incredible self discipline helping him too.  Most people don't have that.

Good talk.  You definitely gave me alot to think about as well.  I like your username.

Yeah that happens constantly, One that burned into my head was this rich kid, like dumb rich, His parents must have been very wealthy because he was like 20 years old in college driving a $100,000 car wearing gucci, armani, versace, etc. He started buying big amounts of weed and painkillers, then cheaper pain killers and eventually heroine.  Last time I saw him he was in pretty rough shape, I feel bad for him but I don't feel guilt, He made the choice to indulge in such substances knowing exactly what they do to you and I have a family to feed.

Not totally propaganda. The lifestyle of most junkies will fuck you up and make you look like shit, but it is not the fault of the drug itself. My dad was a heroin addict for many years, but he came from a relatively wealthy family, owned his own house on the better part of town and generally had enough money to support his addiction(for a while). He has now been on methadone for over 10 years and he does not look like your propaganda addict at all. He might look a little scruffy, but I attribute that mostly to his still ongoing benzo addiction and sporadic alcohol use, I doubt anyone would notice it when he is sober.

Looking back on him I really enjoyed the person he was on heroin. Sure he would sometimes nod out on the couch, but to my child self that was just my dad sleeping. And when he was awake he would be energized, fun and motivating. Always up for a little adventure and really enjoying life. 

His junkie friends were different though, it was easy to tell that they did not have the money, house or family to keep a good lifestyle running. They would look either tired or tweaked out. Dressed and acted like junkies, many of them are now dead, some have managed to quit, but most of the are still addicts in one form or another.

I also never think he would have made it without my mom. She never used drugs, but still stayed with him through addiction. Without her I am sure he would spiral out of control and loose his house, money and family. And without being accepted into methadone treatment I am sure his addiction would eventually end up with him selling the house to further fund his addiction.

So while it is possible to use heroin without turning out like a propaganda addict I think it is extremely hard and not worth the risk at all.

Oh yeah!

My uncle is the most normal and well-off guy I know. He's married to his sister. They both have the same dad.

When I was little, my dad was a coke dealer and would take me and my mom along when picking up from his distributor so it'd look like a family vacation if we got stopped.

Mom's a recovering gambling addict and pill head.

My other uncle is a pill-head who makes moonshine and sells it illegally. Him and his wife let my cousin skip high school because she didn't like it, and the wife did all the homeschool assignments for her. 

My other cousin has had like six abortions and two kids. She's been convicted of selling/using heroin multiple times, but has somehow never spent more than a week or two in jail at a time. 

Her brother is a drug dealer/ex heroin user.

My other uncle is 50 years old and loves all kinds of drugs. Me and him live in my grandmother's basement.

I would be extremely skeptical of this based on the fact that street Heroin is usually a cocktail of chems based around the active ingredient (with variable consistency) so it'd be just about impossible to test that hypothesis correctly. Then there's variables around the preparation of the product for injecting.

Any results of such a experiment would be so variable I'd be skeptical of its repeat-ability, and its value as evidence towards the above conclusion.

It'd be a helluva broad statement to come from a professor of neuropharmacology. Perhaps if he said that medicinal grade morphine taken unfamiliar or threatening environments seemed to make it more effective compared to known safe environments. That would make sense. The presence of adrenalin in the system might alter the uptake of the drug - but that doesn't support the above poster's assertion that Heroin causes OD's in certain circumstances. The majority of ODs don't occur in alleyways - they occur in homes, or squats. That's where the reverse of your assertion should be true (if a threatening environment increases effectiveness, then a less threatening environment should inhibit effectiveness by comparison). Having just scored illicit heroin, the adrenaline level should be elevated in both groups, but the outside groups (by your assertion) should be much more prone to overdosing.

But, I'll couch that by acceptance of a citation to a peer-reviewed study if it's provided.

&gt;Heroin overdose is almost nonexistent. Rather, heroin users who concurrently take tranquilizers, alcohol, and cocaine are those at risk for sudden death. But the promotion of the idea of heroin overdose (seen most recently in the well-off Texas suburb of Plano and the urban ghetto of Strathclyde, Scotland) likely encourages people to use heroin along with other drugs or alcohol.  - [Stanton Peele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_Peele)

From here: http://www.peele.net/lib/heroinoverdose.html

He seems fairly well respected in his field. So, that's a starting point, without me spending any more of my time and effort refuting a nonsensical, un-cited anecdotal (not your fault) assertion.

I was tricked into trying heroin when I was really young and naive. Was a stoner at 14 and had a huge opium fascination. My father is Persian and his stories about opium use amongst the wealthy in Iran aroused my curiosity and downplayed the risks. At 14 my best friend's brother sold me some "opium," which was actually black tar heroin. I found this out after becoming physically dependent and smoking it on a daily basis, at which point I stopped caring. Started injecting the dope at 15 after teaching myself, and started banging speedballs on the daily. 

Maybe I'll edit this later and add some more info about what happened afterwards. 18 now, trying to leave the opis behind. Haven't been so successful

Let me try a couple different ways to help you see it like I think they do:

Turn off your human empathy.  Just picture the person as a giant, red number.  "$-16,203.77"

When you play poker and run out of chips...  You don't get to keep making bets.  You don't get to buy drinks or food with chips you don't have.  You don't get to pay for your hotel room with chips you don't have.  You're politely told to leave the table.  You don't add anything.  You've lost.

Picture someone *addicted to bad choices.*  Pretend heroin, in your mind.  So, a heroin addict shows up at your house, and wants money.  Wow, no.  They've been through rehab three times.  Dropped out half-way through the second time.  Living on the streets.  Giving hand-jobs for cash.  Stealing iPhones.  All of it.  And then the government tells you, "But they *need* heroin!  Here, we'll tax you and your well-off friends, to give this person heroin!"  You think, "Shit, they don't need heroin!  They need *the opposite of heroin!*  If I was a heroin addict, I'd get clean!"  In their mind, someone who is poor, is poor *solely because they chose to be.*  Or because they're physically / mentally incompetent.

Picture a Duke with a million pounds of gold.  Let's form up a gang, and go take it from him!  Yay!  So, the Duke has to hire a bunch of soldiers to protect his million pounds.  He has to pay them some amount.  He's under siege by some brigands...  He makes a deal with his fellow Dukes to defend each other, so they show up as a team and kick some ass.  Or rather, their mercenaries do.  The best mercenaries money can buy!  Eventually, these Dukes make a new Government.  And they all pay in to the Government to hire the mercenaries.  Eventually, they agree to stop using piles of gold - too susceptible to marauders!  They start using paper.  Or even numbers written down on paper.  Or even numbers encoded in a really big abacus.  It gets easier and easier to *defend wealth itself*, that the government needs to spend less and less on marauders.  Pretty soon, the Dukes get tired of spending so much on Government.  So then they start convincing everyone that the rich are paying too much in taxes for things that benefit all of us!  (Even though they *massively* benefit the rich.)  So, they start convincing people to vote on "Flat Taxes."  Or to keep taxing "Income" (which rich people rarely care about) at one rate, while they tax "Interest" or "Capital Gains" (rich people ways of making money), or "Estates" (which is how rich people are born), not at all, or not nearly as much.  Then they invent "Corporal-ations."  Which are like a dead human body that they animate by pulling on ropes.  These corporal-ations have a real body, but no mind.  They're zombies.  But the way the government works, the government will defend these zombies just like people.  But they can never die!  Genius!  So, rather than just an *actual aristocracy,* now we have a *virtual aristocracy!*  Which is even better, because then you don't need to worry about succession and bastard children, or even income taxes!  Because a corporal-ation will never make income - they'll always carefully balance debt and expenses, to never have income!  Or they just move the money to other countries that don't tax.  It's genius!  Entropy constantly increases - law of physics.  But the rich have invented ways to decrease entropy on their property and means of production.  Those ways aren't cheap - they cause massive entropy throughout the rest of the system - global climate change, pollution, suicides in Chinese factories, Jean Valjean stealing bread to feed his kids...  So, as long as you can ignore all that...  You can ignore the farmhands.  In fact, you call them "villains."  That's the etymology of the word "villain," it means "farmhand."  So, a farmhand who has no property and isn't willing to labor for your benefit...?  Parasite.

He laced up his tennis shoes with great difficulty. His hands shook the dirty white laces as he tried to knot up the dirty white shoes he was not used to putting on to start his day. He was not used to any of the clothes he was wearing- the loose, dark blue windbreaker; the slightly too tight, red T-shirt with an advertisement for Joe's landscaping company on the front of it; and the awkwardly baggy gray sweatpants, all of which he had just purchased yesterday at the crummy thrift shop. 

He went back through the experience in his head as he walked out the door of his apartment. He remembered how much he disliked that odd smell of used clothing. In fact, he could smell it now as he made his way down the hall in his second-hand outfit. In addition to the smell in the thrift shop yesterday, he felt a great anxiety as he impulsively picked out clothes that he could not easily be identified in. While he briefly scanned the aisle of clothes hung on hangers on the low racks, he was embarrassed, he is a well-off lawyer and this was no place for his prestigious money to be spent. He almost felt that they didn't want the money in his designer wallet. 

He walked out of the apartment building into the open yet cramped-feeling city sidewalk, and his train of thought halted and restarted on a new track. His mind began to try to wrap around what he was about to do. He had been trying to wrap his mind around this for the past two days. 

He was going to kill the man who his girlfriend cheated on him with. His mind looped through the whole event. Two nights ago, he couldn't get a hold of his girlfriend, who he had gotten into a fight with and hadn't spoken to for a week, so he went to her apartment at 7 o'clock on that Monday- a time he knew she was always home. He arrived, knocked on the door, and the chubby, balding, orange-haired bastard he always saw on the corner at sunrise on the way to work every day, answered it. 
                                         -
Frank sat eagerly in the office chair with his elbows on the top of the desk and his hands running through the orange hairs he had not yet lost due to his horseshoe-pattern baldness. He had been antsy all night in that office. He spent a lot of time and effort on his plan to sneak in and get the man to give him all he had using his girlfriend as a hostage. 

His mind raced. He analyzed the passed out blonde on the ground, unconscious from the chloroform he pressed to her nose whenever she awoke. He was anxious to see the rich boyfriend she had talked about at the bar. He remembered the conversation and how she had lost her job Monday. He also remembered following her home, breaking in, binding her up, interrogating her about her boyfriend, and drugging her repeatedly. 

He tried not to feel anything, but no matter how many times he did things of this sort, he still felt the immense guilt. He tried to fight it off by remembering why he did all of this. He tried to remember the daughter that would never go to college if he didn't. The daughter that would never stand a chance if he didn't. He remembered the poor mother that took her away from him. The mother that loved heroin more than her own child.

Then he remembered the man who came to the door. The man he saw every morning on the corner at sunrise on his way to the diner where he washed dishes. He was infuriated at himself for opening the door. It was an impulse, he thought to himself. How did he think he would pull off a confrontation with the man. As soon as he opened the door, the slick lawyer ran off. What could he have possibly thought? Did he think his girlfriend was cheating on him? I sure hope so. If that bastard called the police. "Damn it!" he said out loud with tears running down his pale, round face.

He stared at the door with watery eyes, and his right hand picked up the handgun from the desk. The room was silent other than the girl's breathing. The lights were off, and he had never felt so alone in his life as the sun rose and daylight began to creep in the office through the window behind him. His emotions became overwhelming and he wept softly and time stretched on in anticipation.
                                         -
The sun was rising and the shadows of the skyscrapers were cast onto the streets, scarcely backgrounded by the warm, golden rays of the oncoming daylight. The lawyer walked with a somewhat quick tempo with his hands in the loose sweatpants pockets, his right hand clenched around a closed flip-out knife until he slowed down to make sure his timing was right to meet the man at the corner as usual.

He was at the end of the block, approaching the corner he always saw that orange-haired son-of-a-bitch. He ran through the scenario he anticipated over and over. He imagined that round face looking at him awkwardly. He could see the awfulness of the situation in the man's eyes. He could almost see himself in the man's eyes. He could imagine pulling the knife from his pocket, flipping it out, and lunging it towards the man's throat, but he could not imagine the blade entering the man's throat.

Tears began to form in his eyes and a lump grew in his throat. His legs grew weak, and he felt like he was the only person on the whole planet. He had no one in his life now, he thought to himself. As he walked it seemed as if he could not get any closer to the corner. He felt like he was on a treadmill and time was standing still. He felt like the whole world stood still. All he felt was himself, all alone.

He made it to the corner and the man was not there. He looked down the street he normally came from and he was not there. He stood at the corner and suddenly he felt everyone's gaze on him. The busy side walks were filled with people, and he felt like all of them were staring at him. The people flowed all around him, and he felt the anonymous criticism of his outfit. He felt the anonymous criticism of the civilians as he obstructed the sidewalk.

He turned and walked back towrds his apartment. He decided he would try to forget everything. He would go home, put on his suit, and go to his office like any other day.

First off, I feel I have to say this so my opinion won't be immediately marked off as "racist" by you: I am not white. I am absolutely not white. My mother is Asian, my father is Indian, Southeast Asian, Iranian, and Arabic. I am not white, so please do not dismiss me as such.

Secondly, your writing is incredibly hard to follow, which is probably the reason I and many others are having trouble taking you seriously. Maybe if you stopped using long parenthetical phrases and run on sentences it would be easier to decipher what you're trying to say, and I mean that in the most polite ways.

&gt; Realize it is improper to discourse about race (I mean: can't we all just get along? Why's it gotta be a Black thing? Puke!) and speak truth to power. You obviously know squat about diversity in representation to use the closet-racist's cliched phrase "for the sake of".

I know diversity. I've been discriminated against. Just because I don't think you should mess with already established icons to be "new and cool and fresh" doesn't mean I'm a heteronormative cis-gendered white male. I'm maybe two or three of those things depending on the day, and the fact that you automatically assume the worst of me and erase my identity because of my beliefs on this makes you no better than the boogeyman bigots you are trying so hard to fight against. I suggest you reevaluate your behavior. Maybe you should "check yourself".

Now onto the points you made:

&gt; You do know that when people get older, they can get wiser, right?

Well unfortunately, wiser doesn't stop your muscles from deteriorating or your hips from breaking in the shower. It's a sad truth. I'm upset as any that we'll never get a "true" Hank Pym, and maybe he will suit up in the film as Michael Douglas, but even then, old heroes just ruin suspension of disbelief.

&gt; Why would it matter if they played up the sexual tension between Harry, Peter, Flash, or any of his daddy issue villians?

Harry was his best friend. If ever there was a character to be portrayed as gay, it would be Harry, the rich, popular, sports jock with an awful dad and a heart of gold. It fits him way more than Peter, and definitely more than Flash.

I don't know if you've seen bullying in school systems, but there is nothing sexual about it. It's not sexual tension or "will they won't they" or Tsundere Yaoi or JohnLock or whatever you seem to think it is. Bullying is awful. Flash was a bully. He has a tragic story of his own, but it doesn't have anything to do with homosexuality or a carnal lust for Peter, and it really shouldn't.

Aside from Harry and Flash, there aren't any other major supporting males for Pete in his age group. Peter is already an outcast (Nerdy, awkward, orphan, even among the Avengers he's the only teen). If they made him gay it would be another thing tacked on, which isn't a bad thing, but it would make all of the bullying revolve around homophobia, which would make it horribly cliché.

Now, on your topic of "daddy issue villains", I really have no idea what you're getting at. MAYBE Otto, but even then it's a stretch. The problem with that is an explicitly gay villain will be dismissed as homophobic unless the protagonist is gay, at which point it's a "gay movie" which both turns off a large crowd and doesn't make money, plus it feels cliche. 

&gt; Or between Cap and his long line of man-boy associates Bucky, Nomad, Falcon, etc.?

Captain America? You mean the Good Ol' Boy Steve Rogers from the 1940's? The God Fearing man? 

Besides being horribly out of character and making very little sense, Steve's associates in the films so far are not "man-boys", they're just men. Adult males. It seems to me like you have a very hard time believing that people can be friends without any sexual involvement. Cap and Bucky are childhood friends, Cap and Falcon are pretty much Vet Buddies. Please don't project your own feelings so desperately onto things like this.

&gt; Tony Stark hasn't had some wild nights with Bowie and Jagger where lines got blurred? Would being a manizer too tarnish the value of his female conquests? 

You know, maybe that would make sense, but the fact remains: this is a movie series. Have you ever read or written a screenplay or a draft? These kinds of things are considered "fat" to be trimmed; throwaway lines that don't have much bearing on the plot. To fit adapted material (which is what it is, adapted) into a screenplay, you only keep the things which are absolutely necessary to defining and establishing a character within the bounds of the story. A line about things like those would be funny, but ultimately dismissible, which in turn hurts your case by lampshading a potentially queer hero's sexuality.

&gt; Adding sexual repression to the Hulk's inhibitions doesn't actually feel all that odd really now that you bring it up.

Bruce doesn't into sex. He can't, it gets his blood pressure up. Romantic interests for him are just the opposite: uninteresting. Plus, he can't have a solo movie for another 4 years when the rights revert back from Universal, so characterization like what you're suggestion would be very hard to shoehorn into Avengers 3 and 4.

&gt;  but there is no reason every heroine has to have a tight ass, maybe in Ops, but Simmons ain't even field cleared.

Simmons isn't fit enough for field. If you knew about fitness, you'd know that. She's fairly slim, yes, but she's within healthy weight. The fact that you say "American pounds" says a lot about you.

&gt; Volstagg is offensive because they have always made eating central to his character, if he was depicted as in the comics I would be far from the first to be making this point

Volstagg is a minor minor character. If you were to nest the Asgardians in terms of importance, it would look like this:

* Thor
    * Lady Sif
        * The Warriors Three

                *Frandal

                *Volstagg

                *Hogun

Point being, Volstagg and the other warriors are there largely for comic relief, much like Ian and Darcy. They aren't major players, they take a backseat to Sif and Thor, and they have very limited screentime. Volstagg's main characteristic is that he's fat? Let him make a lot of food jokes! Frandal takes care of himself? Well he's a pretty-boy dandy, of course! I don't see you complaining about the misrepresentation of Asian cultures with Hogun.

&gt; Microchip

In the comics or the movies? Because either way he's incredibly unimportant that it barely matters.

&gt; Not every hero, even in punch em ups, need be agile, strong, fast, AND flexible

Yeah, they pretty much do. All of them do a lot of physical activity. Actually, name five heroes that don't have at least "above average strength, speed and flexibility" under their belt, I'd like to see what you come up with because I really can't think of any (Tony out of armor doesn't count).

&gt; (really who even has all that? SuperSkrull?).

Off the top of my head? Spidey, Cap, Ms. Marvel, Quicksilver, Black Panther, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Falcon, Thor, Iron Man, Ant Man, Peter Quill. I could go on, but you don't really need an MCU roster now, do you?

Really, your argument doesn't hold much water. Your points on race and sexuality are okay, but in the long run they wouldn't matter because of the way movie production cycles work: Blockbusters are produce to appeal to the lowest common denominator audience. Nationwide that's 63% white, which is the bulk of the audience. In a country with 13% Black population, the execs figure the math works out out of about 20 heroes, 2 are black. What's amazing is that we have a 17% hispanic/latino chunk of the population without *any* representation.

The sexuality thing doesn't work because right now it's a heavily politicized topic, making films about it controversial. Right now, we're in the "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" stage of LGBTQ media, which means all of them have to make some kind of message but still heavily stereotype the minority, but that movie was a necessary stepping stone to get us to things like Black Panther. Once this point in Civil Rights history is over, maybe it'll be safer for studios to make a gay hero, but logistically it's not happening any time soon.

Using Dan fucking Slott as an example of anything other than a botch-job storyteller is usually a bad idea too. 

Try again.

&gt;&gt; It matters not to such a reader that in a world consisting solely of Rand heroes and heroines, there would be neither enough wealth and power to reward them all for their brilliance...

Rand's heroes are tremendously productive people. Having lots of tremendously productive people is not a bad thing. It would be fantastic if everyone was tremendously productive. A productive person creates the wealth he consumes **and** by trade makes everyone else more wealthy.

In the quote, the author essentially says: "if everyone was tremendously productive [world consisting of entirely Rand heroes] there would be not enough wealth to go round."

When he says there won't be enough "power", and when you say "only so many positions influence", you're misunderstanding Rand's heroes motivations. They're not interested in 'power' or 'influence'. Hence when Galt is offered economic dictatorship of the country he's not interested, and why Roark is happy to design Cortlandt anonymously and with no cash payment.

When you say there can't be dozens of successful Ayn Rands you're wrong in the Objectivist sense of success. Success is eudaimonic success. You don't have to be the first or the best to be successful. You can be a successful quarry miner - like Howard Roark.

Just act like you were on your way to buy dope and you'll probably be okay. I made dozens and dozens of trips to rough inner city areas to buy heroin and coke when I was a skinny white teenager. Street gangs don't like local crackheads fucking with their wealthy suburban  customers. They know it's really bad for business if every white kid who comes to the neighborhood gets fucked with. 

The people I was mainly on the look out for during those trips were cops, because driving while white is a real thing in the hood. Cops aren't  stupid so they know a white kid is only in that area to buy drugs so they'll pull your ass over in a second. If anything you should get a black dude to make runs for you to protect you from the police more than the people in the neighborhood. Of course once you get back to the burbs it's much safer for you to he driving.

Yeah, almost everyone I grew up with. The middle school I went to is in a wealthy, "white" populated area. They all got beamers when they became freshman, and drug addictions. 

I don't care about your 2010/11 survey, I can pull some "facts" off the internet to support my claim too. Like this published study by UNLV: http://cdclv.unlv.edu/healthnv_2012/substanceabuse.pdf

 "Nevada youth had statistically significantly
higher rates in overall illicit drug use,
marijuana use, and nonmedical use of pain
relievers than U.S. youths.
Nevada adolescents were ranked second to
the worst tier for their past-year “alcohol
dependence or abuse” and the worst tier for
their past-year “alcohol dependence.
 In 2009, Nevada youths accounted for 3.6% of
the total primary heroin admissions in the
Silver State, whereas the rate was 0.5% for
youths nationwide."

Get off your high horse.

Rents are more expensive in Seattle. My girlfriend wanted to move to Capitol Hill so we could live right by Seattle Central, where she'd be taking classes. It's Seattle's most notoriously counterculture/artistic neighborhood of the last two decades, but it's fighting for air at this point. Since it is centrally located, and a number of powerful tech companies have or are setting up shot in downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill has attracted what are often pejoratively known as 'techies.' I have several friends who have lived in this neighborhood two and three decades who are very cynical and downright nasty about how vanilla the neighborhood is becoming year-by-year. Where once it was blue-collar, working-class peoples, a great deal of them minorities, then the gay community and anarcho-punks and artists and bohemians and open-minded peoples and so on of the late eighties, nineties, and early 2000s gentrified them, now those groups are being gentrified by Amazon employees et al 'techies' and people who look online and see how Capitol Hill is trendy and move here but then take no part whatsoever in whatever abstract ethic originally defined it, so, without intentionally meaning to, they continue to supplant its short-lived bohemian roots and a number of the people who can no longer afford it are moving to Georgetown, Beacon Hill, and the Central District. Right when we arrived my girlfriend and I decided very last minute not to live together after all—I'm perpetually absorbed in my work, sort of critical and melancholy, which is harsh on anyone I perceive as pushing in on my space, and she is equally independent and introverted in her own way. What I mean to say is that the apartment I signed a lease on for a year then doubled in price after two months when she got her own place a few blocks over. Now almost all of my money goes to rent so that I can focus on my novel without taking on a job, at least until it's finished and I seek publication. So while I go out to cafes and shows often, I haven't been able to afford but few records in the past year, no new clothing, nothing like that. Just some drugs and rent and groceries and coffee, not to mention the occasional book or ten to do research for my book, but the cramp's on and I'm pretty hand-to-mouth. This is a theme of many in my book, the changing cultural landscape of hip cities. Similar stuff's going on in Austin. Times change, places change. There's this writing program at UT I'm applying for starting 2016 that's three years. They give you thirty grand a year, some instruction, and lots of free time to produce a major work. Most creative writing programs are a joke, but this one's worthy. It's a half-of-one-percent acceptance rate, but I think I have a serious shot. If I get in, I'm moving back to Austin, and will be recording lots of music in the next three years, home demos or otherwise, while I write my second book and go through that program. If I'm rejected, I'll probably stay up here, but I would seriously consider moving to one of the other neighborhoods I listed, or even somewhere like Portland or Oakland because I have rambler's feet. I still spot heroin syringes on the sidewalks occasionally and the neighborhood still has interesting art and culture, but like I said—it's fighting for air. Signs are plastered around, "WE CAME HERE TO GET AWAY FROM YOU!" or "BRO HOME!" All the light posts this week have large red posters on them about the rent inflation crisis. Catch my drift? Some people who've been here a long time like it more now, which isn't consensus, but you do hear that too. Some people dig the glitzy bars, and how it's become safer (except for a spike in thugs and bros beating up LGBTQ people whereas that really never happened before) which is causing a little social outcry. They have a 'safety shuttle' all weekend that helps out LGBTQ people get home safely. It's a cycle, though. I'm sure the Central District, Georgetown, and Beacon Hill will become better bohemian spots for a while, and then they'll be sucked into the wealthier city-center as soon as they've become a little safer and cooler by the efforts of the original community that took risks (which is never the 'original' community), and by the time their efforts are rewarded with a great neighborhood from the metaphoric rubble, in will flood the wealthy newbies and the bohemians or modest peoples will be pushed further again to some other 'new' old, cheap area, where in turn they eventually gentrify more minorities or blue-collar peoples and so on. Like East Austin, or anywhere. It just goes on. It's a dynamic social fabric, the city's an organism, and betting on static is bad juju.

It all comes down to that sort of, Where's a ripe place that isn't pillaged that I will fit comfortably? And let me tell you, it can be a difficult question to answer definitively. In the end, whatever decision you make will likely be risky (if it's a good one), but that's just the way you've got to play it. I just wish everyone who moved to a place for a perceived quality also did their part to feed that quality instead of being another looky-loo who, often accidentally, plays pawn to its demise.

and yeah, definitely meet up for a beer in Austin. sounds cool.

Okay, here's my take:

1. Everybody gets the money, the same amount.  The government shouldn't discriminate.  I like to think of it as a kind of citizen's dividend, and every citizen is equally a citizen.  There are some edge cases like criminals and children which are up to debate, but they have their rights curtailed in nearly every aspect of society.

2. Different plans have different solutions.  One plan has a national UBI of a flat rate across the board.  Presumably people who live in expensive areas like New York or San Francisco would need to work for more money to live above subsistance.  But the money can be used to move to cheaper areas.  And people in these areas might be able to pool their wealth in other ways.  If there is a State by State plan then there might be more difference in pay.  But that might bring some weird cases where you have people living in one state but receiving a BI from another.

3. There is evidence to show that people don't really make careless choices, unless there is some mental instability, you need to eat and sleep somewhere after all.  We all have this image of a drug addict who spends all they get on heroine, or the gambling addict who will bet their house on the craps table.  Most people who get into that sort of behavior do it because of insecurity in their own life.  A UBI would fix that problem at its root, hopefully.

4. Yes, a BI could be phased in gradually, or staggered in batches.  Or there could be a price freeze when it is rolled out.

5. Money is money.  They could burn it if they want to.  Most on this subreddit are for an universal and unconditional basic income.  This means they are free to do with that money what they will.  To the ultra-rich 1% the proposed $10-15 thousand a year won't make much of a difference if they're making 1000x that.  It isn't the rich we should worry about.

Cigarettes kill many thousands more than heroin - in far more painful, drawn-out and societally deleterious ways. Yet Indonesian tobacco executives aren't being executed. To kill the dealers of one deadly drug, yet allow the purveyors of another to operate with impunity is absolutely disgusting hypocrisy, and morally bankrupt in the extreme.

Sell bottles and work minimum wage jobs that don't drug test. I've known more heroin addicts than pot smokers in my short time working in the shit industry. Herion addicts are too weak to try and mug someone and too fucked in the head to try and rob a house. The rich herion addicts sit and wait for their welf- sorry "trust fund checks" to come in. But they won't go to jail for more than a day even if they have five pounds of pure black tar. They get to go to court ordered resorts in places like Miami.

drug abuse is not really a big problem in Indonesia.  One of the reasons is harsh sentences.  Another reason is that the culture does not have a history of using substances/alcohol.  So for a lot of people, its hard to understand why someone would want to use drugs in the first place.  

A gram of coke cost as much as a months wage, so drugs is mostly done by the rich.  Not really going to get much support from the populace.

The thing is though, drugs could easily be a big problem.  Indonesia is an archipelago and border control by sea is very porous.  Its situated between heroin rich SE Asian mainland and user friendly Australia.  It could easily be a trafficking region much like Mexico is to US and Colombia. 

Another aspect is the remoteness of some parts of the country.  30-40 years ago most of the country is dense jungles.  It would have been easy to  developed  poppie fields that could have finance Communist or Muslim Fundementalist militias like in the Philippines.

I've travelled extensively in many countries and now am in SE Asia. Speed (or "ice") is the drug of choice for Thailand, Cambodia, etc. It's almost always smoked in makeshift water pipes, or "follow the dragon" style. Seems the locals like the boost of power and optimism. Psychedelics, though available,, aren't very popular except among the well to do Thais, though mushroom shakes are offered to the tourists in the islands, as they are on many Indonesian islands, where they grow abundantly (eg on Lombok). In Thailand, dope has severe penalties attached to its use, though foreign users get off with a huge fine (eg $1000). Policemen are quite wealthy in Thailand and some even have to pay the uppers in the police department for lucrative assignments like Ko Phangan, where there's a big drugs scene and lots of busts.

The cops are starting to crack down in Laos too at the party scenes in Vang Vieng (eg $500 fines). Drugs were openly available there for a loooong time, but the cops discovered a lucrative racket in busting young kids for petty infractions (like possession of a single joint). 

Heroin doesn't seem to be very popular among the locals, and opium is considered "Grandpa's drug" by the young. They prefer speed. Weed isn't even smoked that much by the locals, though it's available almost everywhere for the foreigners. The enforcement varies and depends directly on the police presence. If the island is small with no cops, people smoke everywhere with impunity. The local bartender might roll joints for you, though it's available as pressed blocks at moderate prices.

Cambodia used to be the best place for dope in the world (or at least the 3rd world). Everything was available and the cops weren't interested in busting people. That's changed a bit because of US pressure, though weed is permitted and even smoked on the street. It's even used in traditional cooking. There is a thriving business in psychedelics. Ditto for China White (very pure and therefore dangerous heroin). However I've lost contact with the drug scene there. You can still buy ketamine OTC in some drug stores in Phenom Penh since it's sold as an animal anesthetic.

Valium and Xanax are available throughout the area (SE Asia) though not legal for OTC sale at pharmacies. You have to scout around for it by hitting a number of pharmacies. It depends on whether the pharmacy has police protection.

I've seen glue inhaled by kids in Nicaragua, but never in SE Asia, thank God.

PS: All this sounds like I'm a big head, but drugs are mostly in my past now.

I grew up in a "bad" neighborhood. There were gangs, drugs, people were poor, and there was more violence than a wealthier neighborhood for sure. But, people survive, and more often than not, you will be fine if you keep your head down and stay out of the drug/gang aspect of the neighborhood. 

The area is getting gentrified now. Kids from the suburbs and elsewhere are moving in. Sure, there's less violence, but there are still people I know there who can't afford rent now; especially the older folks. It's a lose/lose for them, really.

I think the good portion of a "bad" neighborhood outweighs the negative 10 to 1. We just hear about the negative because people love their confirmation bias. My mom lives in a wealthy outer suburb now with my older sister and her kids. Turns out there's a huge heroin epidemic in the suburbs moreso now than ever, but you don't hear about that as much as you would hear about the stray bullet that hits a child in a poorer neighborhood every once in awhile.
