You need to make sure you're hiring a decent, responsible person. Not just pay the lowest possible wage to fill the job, which will end up with drug addicts, who you will have to drug test. 

If you have to drug test someone to make sure they're not high while they operate a machine like that, you're not doing it right. What happens when they pass the drug test, get the job, get high, crash it and kill someone?

Its short sighted, and usually the practices done by really stupid executives who crawled their way to the top with ass kissing and bullshit, rather then hard work, competence and innovation. 

ya.

Yeah, I'm not looking that deeply. Laws I thought it would be breaking:

*4th Amendement
*Some form of discrimination because it is not truly random and not every student is subjected to a drug test
*Relevants case law pertaining to this include: Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997), Board of Education v. Earls, 122 S.Ct. 2559 (2002), National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), New Jersey v. T.L.O, 469 U.S. 325 (1985), Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602 (1989), Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch.

I see where youre coming from, but arent people making over $200K paying taxes enough to support those living under the poverty level? Maybe not enough is being routed towards those avenues, but that should not put the rich folks at fault.

I agree that it is NOT okay to send the message that those making over $200K should be less susceptible to drug laws. However, I really hope that that tax dollars, collected from both the insanely rich to insanely poor working classes, are not being handed to druggies, you know?

Drug tests are not some punishment against the working poor. They are considered pretty standard practice at most jobs so I do not see why it is frowned upon when the government does not want to give benefits to those that fail a drug test.

I understand there is a perception of double standard here but from my experience, the world does not revolve around ideals. Sometimes you have to weigh the good with the bad. If someone is making $200K, the tax breaks are merit-based. Benefits to the poor are a fixed system and should be regulated considering it is funded by a pool of taxes from everyone.

Sorry if I sound close-minded but the alternative of not drug testing recipients of benefits that are not merit-based just does not sit right with me. Thanks for the thorough rebuttal. Seems rare in these parts lol.

&gt; The war on drugs was used as a new Jim Crow laws and to stifle the counter culture that came out of the 1960s. 

I believe this is pretty correct.  Those evil dirty hippies were a big thorn in Nixon's side, and it was Nixon that ignited the drug war (others - such as Reagan - ramped it up later on).

This accomplished a few things - Nixon, and those in power, now had a legal tool to harass the uppity hippies and others opposed to the government.  This was a method to keep the rabble oppressed.  They could now be arrested and do serious time.  

The government then worked with employers to put the other icing on their cake - drug tests for employment.  With this piece of the drug war in place, those dirty hippies now couldn't even get a job because they can't pass the drug tests.

The whole thing was not about health, or improving 'morality', or defeating crime; instead, the Drug War was put in place to keep the restless lower classes harassed and in check.  The Drug War is nothing but a tool used by a power hungry government to make sure it retains its power by making life difficult for anyone who would oppose it.

The government wants the lower classes as useful tools to fill the factories of the rich and to ship off to fight and die in cases of war.  They don't want to hear from the lower classes regarding government change.  So they push Drug War policies to harass and subjugate the lower classes, make them shut up, and then shuffle them into the various factories and grunt jobs like Walmart employees, or they get to go off and die in foreign lands.

So, if you wonder why they didn't look at the failure of the alcohol prohibition, understand this - they knew, and they just didn't care, and that is because it wasn't really about prohibition - it was about subjugation, and submission, and harassing the lower classes into obeying the mighty government.

Work for several Fortune 500 companies, and have a pal in HR. Their reasoning is if someone is a drug addict, they may be prone to doing shady things to cover their addiction. All of the executives are drug tested... however, that is done internally, and the results aren't down to anyone unless something  ends up on their 8k. For executives, the concern is that they can be blackmailed, and anything that risks shareholder payouts.

Ultimately, past a certain level, they could care less about weed, unless they don't like you and need an excuse to get rid of you. That's why they keep it up, so they have an out of they need it.

Pot laws are changing across the nation. It sounds like if there's a possibility that if he is smoking pot and keeping it from you, that he's at least a functional pot smoker. I have no idea what resources are available to you in terms of treatment and rehabilitation. The latest research indicates that all our current disease models and preconceptions about drug addiction are completely off-base -- that chronic drug use is much less about physical addiction/ mental illness and much more about lifestyle factors, such as chronic stress, poverty, lack of support structures, etc. 

Now, I'm not saying your husband doesn't have support structures. Clearly he does, in you. Lots of drug users do, which is why this new direction of research is so baffling and confronting. We tend to distill things down to a personal level instead of looking at them on a social/ community level. 

Basically, let's look at it this way -- two guys, using pot. Both married, both have children, both employed, and both smoke the same amount and spend approximately the same amount. They live in the same state, so nominally face the same legal risks if caught.

One was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, went to an Ivy League school, and now works for a top financial firm. There are no drug tests at his work. He will not lose his job and income if he is found to be smoking weed, and therefore he is not risking his marriage or custody of his children. His financial security affords him a certain measure of legal preservation, too, as he can afford to hire the best legal representation and post any bail/ pay any fines should he actually have the bad luck to be caught. In short, the most his habit will cost him is a slap on the wrist. It will only ever be seen as an indulgence or vice.

Guy two is your husband. We know his situation. Clearly, his habit is being cast as a moral failing, selfishness, and an addiction. If, miraculously, your family became financially solvent overnight -- you won the lottery, a mysterious fortune was bestowed by a long-lost Armenian relative, whatever -- your husband's pot use would become moot. He would have the financial wherewithal not to have this hung over his head. 

But you know all this. Your problem is the course of action you must decide to take. You have two choices now.

1. Continue to pressure your husband to quit, which you know to be an additional source of stress in this situation. Possibly divert resources to rehab, and risk assets that might need to be kept aside should he test positive again and lose everything.
2. Start researching ways to help him pass the drug tests. 

Now, I'd suggest that you sit him down and talk to him honestly and pragmatically about your concerns, no judgement. If he starts to yell/ defend, don't escalate, just let him run down and then start talking at the point where he interrupted you. Good to have a prepared piece for this. 

First ask him to take the piss test. If he refuses, say that's fine, for the sake of this conversation you will treat his refusal as a positive result -- just as an employer would. Tell him that if he's unwilling or unable to give up pot at the moment, then lying and sneaking around about it isn't helping the family. Tell him that you are his wife and partner, and you put his health and well-being first and foremost. If, for whatever reason, that means he needs to smoke pot to deal with his stress and life situation, then maybe you guys should look at moving to a place where pot is legal, or where he can get a medical card (not really something that could protect him at work, btw). Once he's feeling less attacked/ defense on that front, address the testing issue. Ask what his plan is to avoid testing positive. Do research ahead of time on how drug testers anticipates and addresses the most common tricks, and bring up any arguments or concerns. Ask him what kind of test they use (a piss test, a mouth swab, what?), and plan a response accordingly. 

At minimum, he should abstain from any marijuana for one month, and drink lots and lots of water. That should be something he can commit to, and I hope that since he's continued with his certification and going to work that he has the ability and integrity to put aside pot for one month. 

I think that he shouldn't really be smoking pot at all, since any warehouse accident means a drug test and any pot in his system means immediate termination and that's a drug test/ scenario he can't prepare for ... but one hurdle at a time. Get him past the first test and union certified first. 

And no, I'm not a pot smoker. I'm not even a fan of pot. I personally can't smoke the stuff -- literally can't stomach it. I used to as a teen, but as an adult have developed a bad reaction and can no longer use it at all, which I'm fine with. The culture kind of bothers me, though. Imagine going with your friend to buy wine, and a bunch of giggling women in their mid-30s came through acting like they were so naughty for getting wine coolers. This is what weed is now. 

I was at the weed store with my friend today, and there were a few long-haired toothless men in their mid-30s buying weed. They were making jokes to the clerk like they were still high school sneaking around with their dealer behind gym class and tricking the teachers with their coded slang, giggling at how clever they were. It was like the epitome of the entire pot culture in this town -- thinking it's counter culture as they pay for legal weed over the counter by handing their debit card to a bored-looking retail clerk who runs it through a "wireless atm transfer". 

Anyway, off-topic rant. Sorry. My point is, there's not really a black-and-white morality to this. Your husband isn't a "good" or "bad" man because he smokes pot to deal with what sounds like a slightly-higher-than-average stress load in his life atm (a lot of financial pressure with the union, perhaps an unspoke fear of losing his wife/ child if he fails, financial woes, the stresses of marriage and fatherhood, etc. etc.). There are better ways he could be dealing with the stress, true, but that assumes the time and money for therapy and medication (not to mention the inclination and insurance). Besides, there are also worse ways he could be dealing with the stress. As far as bad habits go, pot is ... not the worst choice he could make. Not the best, but dealable. It would certainly be easier if y'all were wealthy, but then, everything if life would be easier if we were rich, wouldn't it?

So I guess I'm saying ... I don't think your husband is an utter loss. I admire you for standing by your vows. I think that if you approach this pragmatically and with an eye to addressing the situation as a partnership and not necessarily obeying the rules, you'll come out stronger as a couple. There are risks, but life has risks. There are risks no matter which path you choose.

'Murican here.  I can confirm this FWIW.  I lived in Germany back in 2002 for a year for work.  They actually go home at the end of the day.  You just say 'Feierabend' and walk out.  Lunch was long as hell.  You could just go home for a while.  Sometimes you could drink (I could never do that in the US at this job).  Everything shut down all the time for Sundays and Holidays.  Pentecost Monday (it's a thing over there, at least in Bavaria), was like Thanksgiving or Christmas over here in the states.  Practically no work whatsoever got done in August.

German [Ordoliberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordoliberalism) is different from and far more practical than the extremist libertarian nonsense we have in Anglo countries.  So there are not large numbers of otherwise brilliant economists who may be able to do some good, but are all consumed instead with the impossible goal of destroying the state, removing any and all limits to corporate power (including unions), and shredding the safety net at any cost.  They're more concerned with making the country as a whole wealthy.

Anyways, the punchline is that the norm is to work significantly more hours and get significantly less pay and benefits for it in the US than in Germany.  Even doing the same job for the same company and just switching countries effects this.  Those crazy 70 hour salaried workweeks so many of us get used to in the US just don't exist the same way over there.  Nor do the low-wage hourly jobs that call you in all weekend and holiday.  

It's not to say things are perfect, or that it's not convenient sometimes that things never close in America (in comparison).  It's just to say that you should really try working and living some time in another country first before you go casting judgement on it.  You'll probably find it's a mixed bag.  

But most first world countries don't make private sector work so consuming, oppressive and Orwellian as it can regularly be in the US.  Being constantly on-call, always on e-mail, expected to work far more than 40 hours per week, drug tests, required health and wellness data collection and exams, intrusive personal/family questions, family leave time people feel free to take, sick time people feel free to take, vacation time people feel free to take - it's just a different world.  Work in the US seems like punishment sometimes in comparison.

Ugh, the medical systems in some places are so awful if you're not wealthy. I'm sorry treatment isn't economically feasible for you. Also, with regards to passing a drug test to get a job, any job that drug tests without having a damn good reason (such as you would be expected to operate dangerous equipment) isn't worth bothering with, IMO. Only time I ever had to take a drug test was to get the worst job I ever had, which drove me back to smoking weed to cope.

I don't think you have to put up with the BS to become a great artist, you just have to put up with it if you want a career in commercial art, which honestly IMO isn't art, it's just pretty pictures. To me, art is about passion and skill, and the only person you need to compete with is your past self. That's honestly another reason I never pursued it as a career, I didn't want to lose sight of what art means to me.

As for when I was younger, I lost my mother when I was a teenager, and my father and stepmother are, to be blunt, awful people. I was happy when they kicked me out after I graduated HS. When I was 22 I was on my own and trying to get through college, and it was around when I had my second breakdown because I had so much pent-up frustration and unresolved awfulness inside of me that even though my life was a lot better than it had been when I was with my father and stepmother, stress managed to push me over the edge, and I ended up losing the energy to do well in school and my grades plummeted and I eventually dropped out after years off off-and-on schooling with untreated depression. I had a handful of really bad binge-drinking sessions to try to numb the pain along the way, but it just made things worse, so I stopped doing it. I didn't really start using weed regularly until my late 20s, and it's helpful to cope--especially when I'm feeling suicidal--but in the end I honestly think it's probably doing me more harm than good. I strongly suspect that it builds up in my body and aggravates my anxiety, because it always seems like my anxiety gets a lot worse after long periods of frequent smoking, though it might just be that I smoke more frequently to deal with the depression and anxiety.

My anxiety is bad. It affects damn near every decision I make, and every conversation I have. It's like it's added this extra delay to most of what I say because I have to spend a few moments panicking about how what I say will be received. I have to remind myself constantly that I shouldn't try to predict the future and just let whatever happens happen. I'm nervous, and fidgety, and often give people the impression that I'm uncomfortable (which while true is not the impression I want to give) and it leads me to often avoid interacting with people out of fear of saying or doing the wrong thing.

I'm admittedly not doing great now; I made the mistake of trying to renew contact with my father a few weeks ago, it went poorly and sent me back into a downward spiral and one of the worst depressive episodes I've had. I almost never resort to physically harming myself when depressed, but I cut and scratched myself a few times during the worst of it because it was all I could do to distract myself from suicidal impulses.

That said, though, I think I am getting better overall. I still don't have much of a sense of stability or safety in life, but at least I'm working a job I like for a company I like, and I'm actually forcing myself out of isolation and interacting with people more, with notably more successes than failures.

I think the main reason I tried to stress to you to get help ASAP is because I believe that the longer you deal with this stuff without help, the more it digs a groove into your psyche, a rut you can easily slide back into when you think you're doing better. I still  think I can get better--at least enough to function and live a worthwhile, though difficult life--but it would have been a lot easier if I hadn't developed almost a decade's worth of depression-driven bad habits and thought patterns.

At the same time, though, I'm still here, and still trying, so even if you don't get treatment and are stuck living like this for years, at least it's not the end of the world. That only comes when you truly give up.

Wow, ideas that wouldn't blow up inflation or purchasing power. Its amazing how people can't see the consequences of raising minimum wage to $15....

I do think there should be more tax brackets. Obviously wealthy Dont want that as they would he targeted, but in this day 400k shouldn't be the highest bracket. 

I'm also not against increasing the public assistance sector, however not until they reign in all of the people who are taking advantage of it. So many people never get a job or get one just long enough to satisfy requirements. What the money for assistance can be used for needs to be controlled - basic living needs.

And yes you should be able to pass a drug test; the fundamental difference between someone asking for assistance vs someone in DC is that the DC/gov employees aren't asking for extra money / assistance, so I Dont care what they spend the money they earned on. However the person who isn't working asking for money should not be spending any of their money on getting high since, you know, they Dont have enough money to live

Fundamentally a lot of it sounds great, but until you get out and see how so many people on assistance live or what they are doing w their money and time it changes how you feel about it. I'm not saying its a majority, but its not a small enough amount to ignore either..

I went to an elite single-sex private school because my mom worked there and I got heavily reduced tuition (and she wanted to keep me out of the shitty public schools in my district). Wow did I hate it... Every rich-parent elitist, Draco Malfoy prototype fucker, I knew them. 

Found a small clique of friends that were the school druggies -- a combination of rich kids revolting from their parents and financial aid fuckers that were fuckups like me. About half of us got expelled before graduation (did I mention this school thought they were the fucking police -- backpack searches, drug tests, etc...) 

Anyway, I got suspended for a while and was sort of a general pariah among the beautiful young Republican population, but I got a fairly good education out of it, so whatever, trade-offs. Will never attend a reunion to see these assholes running their dad's companies, but I'm still close with a few of my outcast friends.

In the beginning of the second video when comparing conservative and liberal ideologies, I picked up that the teacher mainly talked negatively about liberal ideas and positively about conservative ideas so I decided to discuss what I understand the differences between the Keynesian economic theory and Supply-Side economic theory are and support my liberal side.

According to Webster's Dictionary, a Keynesian economy is "the advocacy of monetary and fiscal programs by a government to increase employment and spending." Basically, Liberals believe that we can fix the economy by more government involvement and by getting the working class to spend money by giving them jobs. I support this system because I believe that every American citizen deserves a chance at the "American dream" and we have to increase taxes a little to help everyone have that opportunity. But both economic theories wouldn't work well at extremes. I mean, if we increase taxes so much to help the poor, then we kind of make pretty much everyone poor and our economy wouldn't grow because people would be frugal with their incomes. If we approach both systems at a mild level, both can pretty much be beneficial, except to different groups. But like the teacher said, over the past years we've mixed them so we're kind of unsure of which works best

The Supply-Side economic system is defined as "an economic theory that reduction of tax rates encourages more earnings, savings, and investment and therefore economic activity and the total taxable national income." It sounds nice, right? We cut taxes so we all get to keep our hard-earned money. My main problem with a Supply-Side economy is that we need taxes for a lot of programs to function and for things like road construction and other federal and state funded things. I understand how by keeping more of our money it could encourage more spending, but then again if you give a bunch of money to corporations, I don't really expect them to be that generous in salaries and job opportunities so it would pretty much just boost the rich spending more money (in my opinion). But I think we need government involvement to give the poor more opportunities, because such a small percentage of people who utilize things like welfare actually abuse it. Here's an article: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/30/the-myth-of-welfare-and-drug-use.html and here's a visual:  http://think-progress.tumblr.com/post/112136283494/states-spend-hundreds-of-thousands-on-welfare-drug
We're wasting so much money on drug testing when I think we could be saving money by trusting our citizens like John Locke said. I know the main issue for many republicans though is not helping the poor. So the economies both work, it just depends on who you really want to support socially.

If anything, I think it is the other way around.  There are lots of high paying jobs that don't drug test.  

Most, but not all, white collar jobs don't drug test. Most, but not all, blue collar jobs do drug test.  Most, but not all, white collar jobs pay more than blue collar jobs.

Business executives (generally the people that make the most money) fucking love drugs.  They would never drug test themselves. Ever seen wolf of wallstreet?

I want Kansas farmers to quit getting paid not to grow crops. I want Kansas legislators and other elected officials to be drug tested before they can collect their government checks. I also want them to be audited for performance-to-pay efficiency and have their pay adjusted to their actual productivity. Most of all, I want Kansas and other states to realize that people on assistance aren't the enemy are certainly aren't the source of the worst waste in this country. Look to the wealthy and corporations to find your true enemies and impediments to regular Americans' ability to achieve the American Dream. We're doing the work, raising the generations coming up to support the low-life scum-sucking takers in this country and they just keep taking while we produce all the wealth without getting a fair slice.

Ok, OHIOents and all who interested in reading.

I want to clarify some things. Mainly the fact that with all the news in Ohio you are only hearing about one bill, and it's a rather bad one. The thing is, There are 4 bills working right now.

So I hope to give you the basics, and because I'm writing I'll throw in what little I know right now. But also I encourage you to do research as well. No one should take for granted what someone else says.

First up, because it's the bill I personally support and think others should to.

Group: Responsible Ohioans for Cannabis (ROC) Amendment: End Ohio Cannabis Prohibition Act (EOCPA) Website: http://LegalAsLettuce.com/, or http://responsibleohioans.org/, which have used the name for years.

My .02$ : This is the best bill out there. It hits all the key points. It allows people 18+ to grow up to 99 plants or possess up to 99 kilos. It allows people to buy and sell with very little regulation, basically the need for sales tax to be applied over 400$ in sales, and a business to sell more than $5,800 worth. IF you want to grow more than 99 plants you come under Ohio's agricultural laws, which any other crop does.

BUT there is more!

Non violent conviction of possession and what not? that would all go away as soon as this is passed. Also unlike

other bills this would go into effect as soon as its officially passed. So lighting up to celebrate will be legal!

There is also a bit about growing in dealing with renting. Basically the owner of property decides if you can grow or not, so if your land lord says no, then no... but if you have a home, or your land lord is cool then yes!

The smoking laws apply, if you can't smoke a cig there, you cant smoke pot there.

AND MORE!

Someone smoking a joint on the weekend is no different than having a beer on your porch, so it would prohibit Ohio employers from doing test for THC. So no more drug test for employment! Yep it protects the rights and privacy of the users!

You can see why I am for this bill and have been collecting signatures for it for awhile now!

The Next group is the medical group.

Group: Ohio Rights Group (ORG) Amendment: Ohio Cannabis Rights Amendment (OCRA) Website: http://www.ohiorightsgroup.org/

My .02$ Now they have been around for while, and have been fighting for medical use. Now that's great and all but I think with a good push and other states having done so already, OHIO getting full legalization is a very good possibility. So I would rather support full legal than half. On top of that there has been some shady things going on in ORG, their president had to step down. I don't know the full context of that but again, full legal trumps just medical in my mind.

Next Group :

Group: Ohioans to End Prohibition (OTEP) Amendment: Cannabis Control Amendment (CCA) Website: http://LegalizeOhio2016.org/

I don't know much about this group honestly, and they have a page listing the good bits of the bill but no bill text. Still not as good as Responsible Ohioans for Cannabis, but they are trying. They would have a system more like Colorado, Medical and recreational separated, state approved dispensary's and that sort. Seems to me to be a whole lot of trouble for something that is safer than aspirin.

And Finally....... The bastards. ( Yes I am editorializing and I don't care )

Group: Responsible Ohio (almost full copy of name of existing group) (RO) This is the group saying they are

working on this year's ballot. Amendment: To be determined, but they are allegedly going to propose a legalization amendment with only 10 commercial growers in the state, 5 testing facilities, 1,000+ dispensaries, and no home growing. Website: http://responsibleohio.org/ (almost complete copy of our url)

They copied our name to make it confusing, they have money pushing the media to promote their bill, its annoying.

They want the rich to have total control of the growing and this latest attempt at allowing home growing is just insane. Just like they have made marijuana illegal in the past this bill would mean you would have to register for a license to home grow. This creates lots of problems. If you have kids you cannot home grow because if you had a license that could be reason for CPS to take your kids away, as well as creating a data base that could be used against those who grow. Also they could simply not give out any licenses. Recently they have had to change their wording because they said no grows within 1000 ft of a church or school, and one of their own grow sites was already in violation of their proposed law, so in the rewrite they added in this growing at home provision to try and stop the notion that they are a monopoly.... but they are. They are a monopoly.  
Anyway, I hope this clears up some things about OHIO's bills!

Damn....you desperately need to get out of /r/politics. Seriously.

Ok, wall of text time.  The story is that myself and two friends were in my car driving through a wealthy suburb of Indianapolis at about 2 pm on a Saturday.  These were the days before smart phones and GPS were everywhere, and I was attempting to find another friend's house.  I had only been there once, a while before, and wasn't sure exactly where it was.  

I pulled into an empty parking lot and parked so I could use my old dumb Trac Phone, which had terrible reception, to try and call the guy.  When I was on the phone I noticed a cop car drive by, do a U Turn, then park in a spot directly behind me.  This made me a bit nervous, so I ended the call, started up the car, and tried to drive off.  

As soon as I started to move the cop flashed his lights.  So I stopped, turned off the engine, and waited.  10 minutes later the cop still gotten out of his car, and I was freaking out a bit.  I opened my car door and started to get out with the intention of walking up to him to see what was going on, and he yelled at me to get back in the car.  10 minutes after that a second cop car rolled up, and he finally approached me.  He refused to give a reason for the stop, just demanded ID from me and my two friends.  We all complied.  He then demanded that my 2 friends get out of the car.  They complied.  After talking to them for a while he came back to me and asked to search the car.  When I hesitated, because the whole situation was weirding me out, he threatened to put me in handcuffs and have me sit on the curb for 2 hours until a police dog got there for a sniff.  As far as I knew I didn't have anything illegal in the car, so I consented.  He found the pot roach in the back seat and crowed like a happy rooster.  I swore it wasn't mine, and even offered to take a drug test, the whole time glaring at my friend who was in the back seat, waiting for him to man up and admit that it was his, which he of course didn't do.

I was put in handcuffs, arrested, and taken to jail where I sat for SIX FUCKING MONTHS.  See, I was on probation for a youthful indiscretion (not drug related) at the time, and since the arrest violated my probation I could not bail out.  When I met with my public defender for the first time he told me as far as he could tell the search was illegal because the cop didn't have RAS for a stop to begin with.  He filed for a motion to supress evidence, which the prosecutor delayed 5 fucking times.  Finally the judge demanded no more delays, we had the hearing, and the judge threw out the case.  The cop tried to claim that he was just sitting in the parking lot hanging out, and that I had exited the car in a suspicious way and tried to approach him, which is when he initiated the stop.  No mention of him lurking behind me and flashing his lights when I tried to leave.  And wouldn't you know it, the damn dashcam was malfunctioning!  My lawyer really hammered him on that, was asking him if it was common policy to be on patrol with faulty equipment, if there was a log of maintenance requests for the camera, if there was a record of him reporting the malfunctioning camera to anybody, shit like that.

Only good thing is that after sitting in jail for six months for possession of .4 grams of marijuana my probation officer ended my probation four months early when I got out.  I think he felt bad for me.

And that is when I learned that cops and the system will try their best to fuck people over for anything they can.

Sorry. Typo with the extra t. 

Listen, this is how you do it:

Call contacting companies. These are companies like manpower, Robert Half or trillium. They place people who have no education all the way through executives. Tell them you are looking for any contacted position at any large company in the areas you prefer. You could say all of Michigan. 

They will find you a job within a month. The corporation will pay the company $20 an hour and you get fifteen. You can continue with wherever you are living and you can commute until you are comfortable with the job / build up enough capital to move. You would think you can skip the middle man and keep the $5 for yourself but most corporate policy doesn't allow that. Also if your contact does end you can find another job through that same company. 

Usually they have offices in every city in the USA, so you can just visit the branch closest to you and fill out paperwork and do drug testing there. 

Don't put your eggs in one basket. Pure Michigan won't hire you until you get experience at this base level. If you're lucky like me the company will hire you from the contractor pool. 

Also screw any mass job email like mlive jobs. Either go to specific corporate recruitment site and find job listing or use the contacting companies.

Ok, OHIOents and all who interested in reading.

I want to clarify some things. Mainly the fact that with all the news in Ohio you are only hearing about one bill, and it's a rather bad one. The thing is, There are 4 bills working right now.

So I hope to give you the basics, and because I'm writing I'll throw in what little I know right now. But also I encourage you to do research as well. No one should take for granted what someone else says.

First up, because it's the bill I personally support and think others should to.

Group: Responsible Ohioans for Cannabis (ROC) Amendment: End Ohio Cannabis Prohibition Act (EOCPA) Website: http://LegalAsLettuce.com/, or http://responsibleohioans.org/, which have used the name for years.

My .02$ : This is the best bill out there. It hits all the key points. It allows people 18+ to grow up to 99 plants or possess up to 99 kilos. It allows people to buy and sell with very little regulation, basically the need for sales tax to be applied over 400$ in sales, and a business to sell more than $5,800 worth. IF you want to grow more than 99 plants you come under Ohio's agricultural laws, which any other crop does.

BUT there is more!

Non violent conviction of possession and what not? that would all go away as soon as this is passed. Also unlike

other bills this would go into effect as soon as its officially passed. So lighting up to celebrate will be legal!

There is also a bit about growing in dealing with renting. Basically the owner of property decides if you can grow or not, so if your land lord says no, then no... but if you have a home, or your land lord is cool then yes!

The smoking laws apply, if you can't smoke a cig there, you cant smoke pot there.

AND MORE!

Someone smoking a joint on the weekend is no different than having a beer on your porch, so it would prohibit Ohio employers from doing test for THC. So no more drug test for employment! Yep it protects the rights and privacy of the users!

You can see why I am for this bill and have been collecting signatures for it for awhile now!

The Next group is the medical group.

Group: Ohio Rights Group (ORG) Amendment: Ohio Cannabis Rights Amendment (OCRA) Website: http://www.ohiorightsgroup.org/

My .02$ Now they have been around for while, and have been fighting for medical use. Now that's great and all but I think with a good push and other states having done so already, OHIO getting full legalization is a very good possibility. So I would rather support full legal than half. On top of that there has been some shady things going on in ORG, their president had to step down. I don't know the full context of that but again, full legal trumps just medical in my mind.

Next Group :

Group: Ohioans to End Prohibition (OTEP) Amendment: Cannabis Control Amendment (CCA) Website: http://LegalizeOhio2016.org/

I don't know much about this group honestly, and they have a page listing the good bits of the bill but no bill text. Still not as good as Responsible Ohioans for Cannabis, but they are trying. They would have a system more like Colorado, Medical and recreational separated, state approved dispensary's and that sort. Seems to me to be a whole lot of trouble for something that is safer than aspirin.

And Finally....... The bastards. ( Yes I am editorializing and I don't care )

Group: Responsible Ohio (almost full copy of name of existing group) (RO) This is the group saying they are

working on this year's ballot. Amendment: To be determined, but they are allegedly going to propose a legalization amendment with only 10 commercial growers in the state, 5 testing facilities, 1,000+ dispensaries, and no home growing. Website: http://responsibleohio.org/ (almost complete copy of our url)

They copied our name to make it confusing, they have money pushing the media to promote their bill, its annoying.

They want the rich to have total control of the growing and have really no bill text for anyone to read.. i hope they give up .

Anyway, I hope this clears up some things about OHIO's bills!

The drug testing has been tried before. It costs the government more than it would save and demonizes the poor unnecessarily. It also lined the pockets of those in office who had connections to the drug testing companies at the expense of the public. Just look at florida as a case study.

The middle class isn't drug tested when they take tax breaks and the rich aren't drug tested before they're allowed to use tax dodging loop holes. It's just an attack on the poor that is based on spite and unfounded anger and which benefits almost nobody.

&gt;As to why Reddit doesn't like libertarians. It has kind of a similar issue as communism, the idea is fine, but there has never been a functional government that implemented it.

Interesting, thanks for the answer. I suppose my spectrum wasn't quite accurately labelled, it should've said something like "economic views" and "moral/social views" on the horizontal and vertical axises (axes?). Because on the spectrum, "libertarian" referred *solely* to your social views, it had no conservative affiliation.

As it is, I am nearly dead neutral on the economic spectrum. For example, I believe laissez-faire and the free market are good for economic gains, yet I also believe the rich should be taxed higher, and welfare should be provided (assuming they can pass a drug test). I also believe in taxes going to public services and govt. programs like NASA, as opposed to the military budget. So it all balances out.

Like you said, the ideals are all there, it's just how libertarianism seems to come in a package with conservative economic views.

Thanks again!

The board of directors, upper management and major shareholders. First drug test them before they can work for or invest in the corporation. Then randomly drug test them on the same basis as company employees with the exact same negative consequences if they fail: immediate termination and loss of income/benefits. In the case of a major shareholder who fails a drug test, the shareholder must be forced to immediately sell the stock within 24 hours or the corporation will buy it for pennies on the dollar. 

There is no reason to assume the rich and powerful are less likely to use drugs than workers who struggle to get by. I would much rather see the upper management of Wall Street companies who crashed the economy drug tested than a struggling low paid worker one paycheck away from destitution. Drug testing is a method of enforcing inequality. If we started drug testing corporate decision makers, members of Congress, the President and members of his administration and SCOTUS, with the consequence of immediate termination and loss of benefits, you can bet that drug testing would quickly be outlawed.

This is all fairly logical, though.

Do you want people to die on the street? No. Ok, then we have to spend money. We pay for them to go to the ER without insurance. That's expensive. Maybe, then, we should give them some money as prevention, so they don't end up in the hospital? 

Now we're already at welfare—now what? 

Now we call them moochers, so we spend *more* money to enforce a moral code. Like you said "I don't want them drinking/smoking on my dime!" So now we spend two dimes: one to keep them out of the hospital, one to pay someone to stop them from drinking and smoking. 

That's where we're at now, and why people say things like "it's not efficient to drug test." Their question is "why should I pay more money, above trying to keep them out of the hospital, to try and enforce my goals and morals on people I'll never meet? Why can't I just keep the money for my own goals and dreams? Or give it all to them so those who are capable can rise up and contribute?" 

To be a little crass: we value human life, we value giving people a basic chance. The question is, above that basic chance, is it really the job of government to spend money to stop them drinking? It's cheaper to pay them to sit in a pile of filth and die naturally after a little while, and they circulate some money in the mean time. The cheapest thing for me, as a hypothetical wealthy taxpayer, is to write people a check to keep them out of my medical system—if they spend all the rest of that on booze and video games and never go outside, it doesn't effect me. 

However, unfortunately, when you only give people enough to stay alive, they often up in our hospitals and jails, which costs us a huge amount. If we were to give them that amount outright, they'd be pretty well off—enough to get an apartment and a car and a big screen to lounge around and really live the mooching life you imagine. 

This is where I'm confused by republican ideology. "Let them pick themselves up by their bootstraps" sounds to me like "make sure they don't die on the street, but if they want to make something of themselves, that has to come from them. Yet we want to help them by paying to guide them away from drugs? Is that any different from the democrat stance of "we need to help them get a job directly"? 

The empirical data supports the assumption that giving people a lot of "free stuff," even so far as giving them an apartment and cash, is actually cheaper than going partway and just stopping them from drinking. Why doesn't the Republican Party go for the less expensive, more effective option? Is the feeling of "people mooching off my money" so strong that you really want to spend more money to feel better? 

The truth is, by being a little freer and "giving away" more, we could in fact scale back taxes, potentially, while increasing the number of people actually paying the taxes.

&gt;You can't defend marijuana by saying, "well but they let them use this other drug!"

Didn't say that. Basically I said drug testing was ineffective and onerous.

&gt;They get to say what you can and cannot do because they have more power, leverage, and money than you do. You can't demand rights the government doesn't afford to you and still expect to be given the chance to work there.

And therein lies the problem. They consistently abuse that power. It is not any one company or industry, but is nationwide.

I'm not talking about the current state of rights, but what should be.

With the unions being so weakened there are a lot less worker protections. Effective wages continue to fall. Breaks get shorter and policies get tighter. The drug testing is just a small part of a huge problem.

I would kill to be in a union.

The companies should work for the people. They use our resources natural and manmade and a few get wealthy. They use our backs and our sweat and we don't get fair compensation. We are subject to humiliating piss tests, asinine policies, forced overtime so upper level gets bonuses, random layoffs without notice, retirement plans have been gutted. This is not just where I work now.

I have zero sympathy for business, corporations, CEO's. I have limited sympathy for small business owners, I've seen some awful abuses from them as well.

Might doesn't make right.

Also, please don't imply I'm not smart for picking my particular career. That really adds nothing to the discussion, and you have little idea of the choices I had available at the time.

Good business moves are amoral.  Google's former policy of do whatever Friday's allowed them to rapidly expand their software offerings, and cull the field after it had been discovered which ones people cared about.  I'd bet that there's a clause in the employment contract that says "whatever you build on Google's time is Google's stuff."  They traded eight hours a week for ownership of everyone's pet projects, and increased productivity during the week to boot.  Fantastic business move, and I've not heard one person call them out for being flexible regarding work hours.

Also, look at things a different way.  Everything a large company does, moral or immoral, is being done because someone believes it to be a good business move.  We don't hear about things unless they're close to an edge of the bell curve, morally.  We don't hear "mid level manager fired for sexual harassment" or "call center employee fails drug test."  The only things that really matter are things that happen with the top executives' blessings, and that are either extremely immoral, or extremely altruistic.  Bill Gates has dedicated himself to spending his giant piles of cash curing diseases in poor places.  Luxottica used disproportionate industry size to crush Oakley into submission.  

The difference is that Bill Gates is a person, who can do whatever he wants with his stuff, and Luxottica is a publicly traded company with a legally binding contract saying they have to do what they can to maximize shareholder value.

There are many designer PEDs and more being created all the time.  Drugs with the effect of steroids that can be masked or controlled in a way to skirt drug tests.

It's a very grey area and the companies creating &amp; selling them don't exactly want public attention.  So it tends to be a luxury item, targeted specifically at wealthy athletes.  The NFL being the biggest obvious organization benefiting from it.
<TRUE,FALSE>
------
&gt; But if they are to be enforced, they should be applied fairly to all races.

I agree.

&gt;They are currently disproportionately targeting Black people.

Before making an accusation, I'd like to investigate all possible reasons for the rate or arrest and conviction may be different--

1. How whites and blacks (on average) deal drugs may be different and those who engage in more easy to observe methods may be more liable to be arrested.

2. It could be an income thing and not a race thing. That is rich people are less likely to deal/use in places where they could be caught and if caught may pay for high-price lawyers to prevent conviction. Thus it would be a reason of correlation without causation.

3. Size of distribution channels. If blacks who deal drugs have bigger networks of distribution, their chances for getting caught increase.

4. Presence of prior convictions. If one race is more likely to have a prior conviction (property crime, domestic orders, etc.) then they are going to be more likely to be convicted and if their probation requires drug testing, a positive drug test makes it easier to get caught.

5. Length of time of use and distribution would affect the results. For example, if you had one race who had 50% use but an average of 1 year and a second race with an average use of 45% but an average of 10 years of use, the second race is more likely to be caught and convicted.

6. Incentive to request criminal record scrubbed. It could be that white people are more likely to ask to have their criminal records scrubbed after time.

7. White people may be more willing to report a history of use/distribution to a survey (and thus the data is wrong).

...or it could just be that our system is full of racists who target blacks. But if it were, I would expect it to be pockets of discrimination where it would be quite obvious compared to other geographies. So if there was racism, I would look for such pockets of racial targeting.

My public high school(6 years ago now) had random drug tests and they bought a drug dog. They would walk the dog the hallways randomly and out in the parking lot. 

Drug tests were only for athletes and worked really weirdly. If you failed once you had to take it again. if you failed a second time you took it again. If you failed the third time, you were suspended for a couple weeks. I think 2. Not many people failed the third time since they had to send the tests away for some reason. Had like a week gap between tests. 

Oh and the tests werent random at all. The dean of students would walk in and randomly pick. He was also a football coach. He would pick the kids who didnt smoke on purpose. I never smoked in high school, so overall I probably got tested 12-16 times in high school. 

The drug dog was new my senior year. I smoked cigarettes at time and so did some of my friends. Dog hit on his car. They tore his car apart and found some cigarette ash. Suspended him. His mom(she is pretty wealthy) threatened to sue and they dropped everything.

My high school was weird.

&gt; Overwhelming (perhaps unanimous) consensus among NFL officials  is that the Tuck Rule was properly applied. 

This, and the fact that it was called against the Pats, doesn't change the fact that it's a ridiculous god damn rule in the first place. It may have passed the NFL official test (who always give the Pats any ruling they want, anyways, so why would they admit after the fact that it was a bad call?), but to ANYONE watching it, it didn't pass the bullshit test. 

And yes, Vinny did hit a great kick, and you guys did beat the Rams. No one argued that. But you needed that dumbass rule for it all to happen.

&gt;The newspaper that reported the story about Pats taping Rams walkthrough before SB XXXVI retracted the story and issued a public apology to the team for printing false claims.

I just now looked that up and saw that about the Rams game. Point conceded. 

&gt;Yeah so you're just dead wrong here. For the express purpose of transparency, Goodell played all the tapes on a loop for the pool of reporters present for his press conference where he announced Spygate sanctions.

Yeah I'd like to see a source for this, because I can't find it. Even the source I found about Glazer seeing them indicated that there were more that he DIDN'T see, but didn't seem interested in. 

&gt;Says that they show gasp defensive signals.

Against the rules, yes? Then it's cheating.

&gt;Seriously, what sanctions should the Pats have faced?.....Goodell issued the harshest fine in league history against Belichick and the Patriots. Not only was Goodell NOT in the bag for Kraft, but he came down with an INSANELY overreaching and disproportional punishment, mostly in an attempt to prop himself up as some "tough on crime" sheriff in his second year on the job.

What kind of punishment? Oh, I don't know, maybe something that might actually punish the Pats as an organization rather than just take some relatively small amount of money from two insanely rich men? Seriously, BB has an estimated net worth of $35 million and an annual salary of $7.5 million. You think he misses $500k? 

As well, who gives a shit even if he were fined his full year's salary? Nothing happened to hurt their chances on the field. NOTHING EVER DOES TO THEM. A player fails a drug test, he gets suspended for four games. Saints coaches get caught doing shady shit, suspended a year (and Greg Williams for longer than that). But BB gets caught cheating? Nah, he just misinterpreted the rules, let him keep coaching.

&gt;Mort reports that 11 of 12 balls were 2 psi under. Rapoport said only 1 was, with the rest being a few ticks under.

No, no. [One was a full two pounds under, "several" were a pound under, and several more were at, or just under, the mark.](http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/02/01/deflategate-only-one-patriots-football-underinflated) One pound under is still under the minimum. Just barely under, is still under.

But fine, we'll wait for the report. Not that anyone legitimately believes the NFL would ever say a negative word about the Patriots in the first place.  

&gt;If there's nothing wrong with being a game manager, why are you and Tosh using it as a pejorative?

I can't speak for Tosh, as I don't know the man. But I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with being a game manager, if that's what your team calls for. Really, I think Brady is a damn fine game managing QB for a number of reasons, including his longevity, how few mistakes he makes, etc. And it clearly works for the Pats, so why change it?

&gt;Fact is, Brady has never had a dominant running game, and yet has led the highest scoring offense in the NFL over the past 8 seasons while winning 2 MVPs and setting regular season and playoff records.

They may not have had some kind of 90's Dallas Cowboys type of dominant running game, but they have just about always (with the exceptions of a couple of seasons) had a very reliable running game. I mean hell, the last three times they've played the Colts, they've just put whoever the hell they wanted in there and they've gained about 200 yards rushing per game. 

As well, a lot of the Pats' pass plays are sort of like extensions of the runs. Picks and screens are basically runs in the modern NFL, except that they also rack up yards for your QB's stats to pad (and no that's not a shot at Brady as nearly all QB's benefit from that nowadays). 

Also, do you know what the Pats HAVE had each time they've won the Super Bowl? An INCREDIBLE, playoff-built defense. Seriously, those first three Super Bowls especially, there probably hasn't been a collective defensive unit that was together for so long, and that was as good for so long, as the Pats had those years. Except maybe the Ravens for a stretch. 

Why do Pats fans think that Brady is a god that wins all of their games by himself, and never give their own incredible defenses any credit? It blows my mind. I'd have killed to have that good of a defense on the Colts, just ONCE. During this era or the Manning era.  

And no, I didn't bring this up, but since you did:

&gt;AFC East is the 3rd strongest division by record since 2000.

That may be, but there has never been even a threat of a good/great team from the AFC East over that period. Your division has one great team (Pats) and three that are always bad or mediocre. You guys rarely have true bottom dwellers (like Jacksonville) but instead regularly have teams that get 6-8 wins. Despite what you want to think, that doesn't make your division magically the toughest division in the league, though. Most other divisions have at least one other really good team pop up now and again. The AFC North is much more competitive than the AFC East, even if their overall record isn't as good, because every year another team is competitive enough to be a THREAT to win the division. But not the AFC East. It's always the pats at 11-16 wins, and someone else at like 8.

And lastly, again. Why bother coming to our sub to troll? You guys have your own sub that we don't even bother at all. Why not stay there and enjoy yourselves? Do you just have nothing better to do with your time? I have literally never even been to your sub, and if the Colts had won, that fact wouldn't have changed.

She used to date one of the executives at the company, who she is still on good terms with, and put in a good word for me.

What are your sources of the .2%?

Assisting those that are just wildly spending money on stupid crap, doesn't help anyone either. Here we are paying for their lifestyle?  

&gt;You've so completely fallen for the 'let the rich make the middle class angry at the poor' tactics of the GOP that you're willing to shoot yourself in the foot?

That's a rather bold assumption. Who's going to pay for the diabetes. The schooling. Their healthcare. Their alcoholic problems. Their poor choices. I know there are exceptions to every rule. But the drug testing isn't quite the same as this. It's not a get rich scheme that'll be seen overnight. Why should we pay taxes to support bad habits, healthwise and financial wise? 

The goal is to save money as there's more than one avenue of problems. Reconsidering how welfare is used is something that needs to be addressed. 

You make it a point as well, on how it'll save money, is no difference, other than the restrictions to actually prevent years and years of bad choices. it's not about money today, but money in the future. Setting up an auditing plan for 1-5 years for a more permanent outcome in the years to come, makes more sense than saving, now. But it's politics. Cost more now, or cost more later?

Gore on interventionism:

&gt;Q: What principles would you use to distinguish cases that require US action and those that do not? A: I think that we were right to go into East Timor. I thought we were right in Kosovo and Bosnia. I think we were tardy, frankly, in Rwanda. We have to have a national interest. We have to be willing to accomplish the goal. We should have allies to help us, but our national interest should also be defined in terms of our values. And ethnic strife is important to address.

Gore on abortion:

&gt;In 1992 on the David Frost Show, Gore said he still regarded abortion as the taking of “innocent human life” but conceded that he no longer used such phrases in letters because they are “so loaded with political charge.” He added, “I think many of us have mixed feelings, because there are two questions involved. The first question is how you feel about an abortion in a given set of circumstances. And the second question is, who makes the decision? And regardless of how you and I might feel about the rightness or wrongness of a given decision in a particular set of circumstances, I believe the government ought not to have the right to order a woman to accept its judgment about how to weigh the different aspects of the decision, and order the woman to make the decision that government says she has to make, instead of leaving the decision to her. I’ve always believed that.

Gore on crime:

&gt;Gore believes in the approach to law enforcement called “Broken Windows”: that a targeted assault on all crime and disorder, large and small - from graffiti, broken windows, and crumbling buildings to more serious crimes - can create an environment in which people respect the law, each other, and the community in which they live.

Gore on death penalty:

&gt;Q: What about the death penalty?

&gt;GORE: I support the death penalty. I think that it has to be administered not only fairly, with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention. If the wrong guy is put to death, then that’s a double tragedy. Not only has an innocent person been executed but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it, and in some cases may be still at large. But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.

&gt;Q: Do both of you believe that the death penalty actually deters crime?

&gt;GORE: I think it is a deterrence. I know that’s a controversial view, but I do believe it’s a deterrence.

Gore on drugs:

&gt;Gore proposed federal spending of $500 million a year to help states test, treat, and counsel prisoners &amp; parolees for drug use. Inmates in state prison-mandatory testing already applies in federal prison-would not be released until they could pass drug tests. Further, parolees could be returned to prison if they failed the tests, which would be administered twice a week. Parolees would also be subjected to stricter supervision, to ensure that they paid child support, stayed off drugs, and found jobs.

Gore on the size of the government:

&gt;Gore said, “I don’t believe there’s a government solution to every problem. I don’t believe any government program can replace the responsibility of parents, the hard work of families or the innovation of industry. A return to big government would be as wrong for our economy as a return to big tax cuts for the wealthy.” To that end, Gore vowed: “I will not add to the number of people doing work for the federal government, not by even one position, and there will be more who leave those ranks than the ones who are replaced.“

&gt;He also said he would shrink the federal government to its smallest share of the economy in 50 years and would begin a second phase of the ”reinventing government“ initiative that he had directed for Clinton. The first phase cut the number of federal jobs by more than 300,000, Gore said. A Bush spokesman said it ”strains credibility“ for Gore to take credit for job cuts because the vast majority of those resulted from the post-cold-war retrenchment in the armed forces.

"staffing services" company, contingent worker company, temp agency, sometimes disparagingly called a "head shop," in that they might only have a small recruiting and executive office, and employ a small army of consultants, but no operations, or computer lab facilities.  Their executives do the sales and accounts management.

This consulting company finds software development gigs in my state that might be in need of staffing for my specialization role that I have experience in (software QA &amp; automation), arranges contracts and sends me to the client sites.  My job is basically 100% travel to local client sites in my state.  The contract duration is usually 6-9 months, maybe a year.  Some client companies stipulate maximum one year limit for contractors, certain other client companies have no limit and can potentially employ someone for years.

Naturally, to make a profit off me, the consulting company bills me out to the client at a high rate (say, e.g. $120 \ hr.) while paying me a fraction of that (say e.g. in the range between $20\hr. to $30\hr.) and pocket the difference as profit revenue and operating costs.

I am considered a "permanent" employee of the consulting company  in that I am salaried and I receive Health and Dental benefits.  It is true, I could be laid off from my consultant job at any time, especially if management perceives that I am burned out or "damaged goods," and so the trick is to always maintain good perceptions and make yourself look useful and valuable to the company.  In between assignments, there is the chance of being put "on the bench," which might be viewed as a limited form of stay-at-home vacation (e.g. I shouldn't travel out of state, I should be prepared to interview at the next gig, submit to drug tests, attend consulting company functions if needed, etc.).  In fact, recently I just had 4 weeks of bench time in between gigs and I was paid my regular salary for those 4 weeks (the consulting company basically ate the costs in order to retain me on the salary for theoretical future profit-making value, but there's a limit to how long they'll keep someone on the bench).

The disadvantage to working for a quote-on-quote "head shop" is that you never stick around at any one place for too long.  You make friendships with some coworkers, have a crush on that cute blonde two cubicles down, and then the relationships end if and when you get assigned to the next gig, and the blonde doesn't respond to your emails asking her to dinner WHYYYYYYY JENNIFER WHYYYYYYYY PLEEEEEASE LOVVVVVVVVVVE MEEEEE!!!

Ahem, but the advantages of working for a so-called "head shop" are many:

* Due to the project-based and contract-based nature of all IT work, essentially all projects are temporary by nature and design.  There is no such thing as a "permanent" project.  Even fulltime "permanent" employees of corporations get shifted between project to project as budget and allocation needs arise.
* If you're a fulltime employee of a company, you can be laid off unexpectedly at any time with little or no warning.  If you're a contractor, at least sometimes you'll know your contract end date in advance, so you can prepare in case you're laid off at that time.
* If you remain at one company for too long (5+ years) your skills begin to erode and stagnate.  A C++ programmer with 25 years of experience in C++\MFC\Win32 API is shit useless in today's modern industry of enterprise web development.  He would have to know at a minimum, C#.net + ASP.net (and preferably HTML\CSS\JavaScript) to get a C-language related job. 
* Thus, as a contractor or consultant, by moving from contract to contract, you have a chance to constantly learn new skills and improve, get exposed to different company's takes on Agile software development, and get to learn more about computer science and software engineering than you ever could if you just stayed at one company your entire career.
* Your network of professional references, connections, and LinkedIn friends increases over time as you meet new people at client sites.

So in my opinion, there is no such thing as a "real" or "permanent" job.  All jobs are "semi-permanent" in nature, in that the company could go out of business, or you could be laid off at any time.  In my opinion there is no intrinsic advantage in being a regular fulltime employee of any company, given the following truths:

* The management's attitude that all workers (who are not executives) are replaceable and a dime-a-dozen.
* The high degree of churn, revolving door, and turnover in the IT industry.
* The only way to negotiate a *significantly* higher salary is basically to switch companies, or go to multiple interviews, get multiple job offers concurrently, and pit them against each other as negotiation tools (e.g. "Company X offered me your salary offer + $3000, so I would like original salary offer + $3000 + $2000 to come work for you instead of them."

Now there are I suppose certain benefits in "permanent" jobs, especially if you're trying to raise a family and want kids and stability, but you better be pretty high up within the food chain and be considered extremely valuable to the company (architect-level, lead software engineer level, or higher) if you choose to "settle" in a permanent job with a baby at home, as you better be damn near un-layoffable or "untouchable" as it were, in order to consider yourself truly "stable" for the time being.  

Unfortunately, few developers who are first-tier (non-lead) are un-layoff-able, and my specialization role (QA) sure as shit isn't stable, we're all dependent on development for our work, thus they could choose to cut their entire QA force at any time, since when push comes to shove, you *need* developers but you don't "really" need QA all that much (you can have other developers test each other's code).

So in reality unless you're a somebody such as management, executive-level, senior architect, or senior lead developer, you're better off being a corporate mercenary who works as a consultant or contractor, because the only way nobodies at the lower levels can survive in this workaday world is to move from gigs to gigs and continue to gain more experience in an increasingly wider swath of tools and technologies, thereby increasing one's competitiveness to recruiters and hiring managers in the industry.

If you compare my resume and list of tools and technologies used, as 6 years of consulting in QA, to someone who has been in a C# development position at a company for 10-12 years, you may find that the latter is more "limited" than I appear to be, in that I appear to be more broadly experienced, having jumped ship, even drastic technology stack transitions (from Java to .NET) every year or so.  And since perception is reality, the first impression upon recruiters and hiring managers matters.

They know that all blacks are not on drugs, but there's no profit in dispensing with that myth. They need the wealthy in this country to hate minorities in order to advance their profit motives and control agendas. That's why, no matter how many times welfare drug testing is proven to have no effect on anything, they still pump that shit in the media. Over and over and over, keeping the divide in place between people and keeping poors and minorities under their thumbs.

When tests for alcohol are done as well, I'll agree with you. Until then, it just appears alcoholics can skipper for-profit charters without any worry of failing a drug test... at least until they get a DUI. I think the frustration is that our society is still adjusting to what recreational drugs are outside of alcohol.. and normal people are still punished for what executives/HR/insurance people deem acceptable. Which kind of sucks. ie, Computer Programmers getting drug tested.

Let's also require drug tests for everyone who gets subsidies from the government. You want to get that sweet, sweet government money for growing corn or drilling oil? Prove to Uncle Sam that money isn't going to your executives' crack cocaine habit.

I was with a guy who everyone loved- I'm talking, friends, grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts, probably random strangers. Everyone.  I was 22 when I met him and was head over heels in love (lust) and he was from a "good" i.e. wealthy family.  Things were a bit strange in that he was a "virgin" when we finally had sex despite having the sex appeal of a adonis.  Can confirm since it was about 2 seconds and awkward. He was Catholic so I figured his hesitation towards sex was based on that.  He was a bit of a loner, and his friends were not really-what I thought- up to his standards.  I knew his roommate for instance had a coke problem.  Fast forward two years later of seemingly relationship bliss and he gets into a big car accident (which I drove by....).  He refused to take an ambulance and I found him trying to piece his ear back together in the bathroom.  You can bet I brought his ass to the ER.  Things got strange after that.  He would disappear for even longer periods of time (he had a tendency to go for drives when he was stressed).  He gives me an "engagement" ring he had designed especially for me so that I would "keep it safe" until the day came where we were officially engaged.  It didn't fit right so I put it on my dresser.  He borrowed it from me to have it cleaned and resized.   Things were rocky and I wanted us to take a trip together.  The day before leaving I was in his car (his sisters borrowed car since he totaled his), waiting while he was playing paintball with colleagues from work. I noticed a certificate on the floor of the dirty car and pick it up.  It was a pawn certificate.  Of my engagement ring.  My world starts to unravel.  Its in his name, the description is my ring exactly.   In a panic I start tearing through his car.  I find other pawn certificates describing jewelry his mom was missing, along with a bag full of gold chains, and other bits of jewelry.  Along with it are cut tubes from straws and pens.  I also found pills.  I confront him- and by that I mean totally flip ape shit.  He tells me it was his old roommate, the one with the coke problem.  He had been trying to frame my boyfriend and cover up his drug problem and had "stolen my ring".  I force him to take a drug test to prove it.  He won't let me in the room as he does it and keeps finding reasons to delay taking it.  It comes back clean.  I try to believe him about the roommate.  Days later I follow him to the police office and he comes back with "evidence" case on my stolen ring including a CD that had pictures of the ring in his roommate's possession that my boyfriend had the wherewithal to take when he found his roommate with my ring.  

Fast forward awhile later, I have moved out.  My boyfriend begs for me to come home.  I tell him I will on one condition.  There must be nothing drug related in the house.  I don't hear from him and go to his house.  I find him passed out in the back of his car completely unconscious.  I start screaming but he wont respond.  The rest of the house is torn apart.  There are pills, straws, more pawn certificates, western union orders, everywhere.  I don't know what to do so I call his dad.  Finally my boyfriend stumbles into the house, unable to even form sentences.  Luckily his dad arrives and forces him into the car to the hospital.  There he is put in the psychiatric ward as he became violent.  Long story short, it wasn't his roommate with the drug problem, it was him. He had faked police evidence, stolen money from his mother and me, stolen both our jewelry and pawned it.  I went further into his computer and found he had been selling opitates online from our house, and had craigslist ads for gay sex. I ended up leaving the country to get away from him because he wouldn't let me go.  Even a year later I had crying voicemails on my phone from him.

Ok, OHIOents and all who interested in reading.

This is a short post, I will have more later hopefully, but I want to clarify some things. Mainly the fact that with all the news in Ohio you are only hearing about one bill, and it's a rather bad one. The thing is, There are 4 bills working right now.

So I hope to give you the basics, and because I'm writing I'll throw in what little I know right now. But also I encourage you to do research as well. No one should take for granted what someone else says.

First up, because it's the bill I personally support and think others should to.

Group: Responsible Ohioans for Cannabis (ROC) Amendment: End Ohio Cannabis Prohibition Act (EOCPA) Website: http://LegalAsLettuce.com/, or http://responsibleohioans.org/, which have used the name for years.

My .02$ : This is the best bill out there. It hits all the key points. It allows people 18+ to grow up to 99 plants or possess up to 99 kilos. It allows people to buy and sell with very little regulation, basically the need for sales tax to be applied over 400$ in sales, and a business to sell more than $5,800 worth. IF you want to grow more than 99 plants you come under Ohio's agricultural laws, which any other crop does.

BUT there is more!

Non violent conviction of possession and what not? that would all go away as soon as this is passed. Also unlike

other bills this would go into effect as soon as its officially passed. So lighting up to celebrate will be legal!

There is also a bit about growing in dealing with renting. Basically the owner of property decides if you can grow or not, so if your land lord says no, then no... but if you have a home, or your land lord is cool then yes!

The smoking laws apply, if you can't smoke a cig there, you cant smoke pot there.

AND MORE!

Someone smoking a joint on the weekend is no different than having a beer on your porch, so it would prohibit Ohio employers from doing test for THC. So no more drug test for employment! Yep it protects the rights and privacy of the users!

You can see why I am for this bill and have been collecting signatures for it for awhile now!

The Next group is the medical group.

Group: Ohio Rights Group (ORG) Amendment: Ohio Cannabis Rights Amendment (OCRA) Website: http://www.ohiorightsgroup.org/

My .02$ Now they have been around for while, and have been fighting for medical use. Now that's great and all but I think with a good push and other states having done so already, OHIO getting full legalization is a very good possibility. So I would rather support full legal than half. On top of that there has been some shady things going on in ORG, their president had to step down. I don't know the full context of that but again, full legal trumps just medical in my mind.

Next Group :

Group: Ohioans to End Prohibition (OTEP) Amendment: Cannabis Control Amendment (CCA) Website: http://LegalizeOhio2016.org/

I don't know much about this group honestly, and they have a page listing the good bits of the bill but no bill text. Still not as good as Responsible Ohioans for Cannabis, but they are trying. They would have a system more like Colorado, Medical and recreational separated, state approved dispensary's and that sort. Seems to me to be a whole lot of trouble for something that is safer than aspirin.

And Finally....... The bastards. ( Yes I am editorializing and I don't care )

Group: Responsible Ohio (almost full copy of name of existing group) (RO) This is the group saying they are

working on this year's ballot. Amendment: To be determined, but they are allegedly going to propose a legalization amendment with only 10 commercial growers in the state, 5 testing facilities, 1,000+ dispensaries, and no home growing. Website: http://responsibleohio.org/ (almost complete copy of our url)

They copied our name to make it confusing, they have money pushing the media to promote their bill, its annoying.

They want the rich to have total control of the growing and have really no bill text for anyone to read.. i hope they give up .

Anyway, I hope this clears up some things about OHIO's bills!
<TRUE,FALSE>

&gt; Now, I will say I fully support a flat tax in the form of the FairTax...

Ooh, thanks for bringing this to my attention. I wasn't aware that a flat consumption tax has already been proposed to Congress.

&gt; All that being said, if I am provided with a basic income that will cover all basic expenses needed to survive (food, shelter, minimum utilities, clothing, basic education, etc.) what incentive do I have to work for anything? Other than a desire to lead a more comfortable lifestyle, what reason do I have in working to better myself if the government is just going to take care of me?

Reasons why people might continue to work after receiving Basic Income:

(1) They enjoy it.
(2) They find their job fulfilling.
(3) To socialize.
(4) To do something they think is important.
(5) To earn extra money and live a more luxurious lifestyle.

...etc. If you look at the results of the Mincome experiment in Canada, they found that it was mostly only teenagers and single mothers who quit their jobs after receiving the Basic Income. Almost everyone else continued working. The theory that 'humans are lazy and would sit around doing nothing if they didn't have the incentive to work in order to earn enough money to have their basic needs be met' is a fallacy. Also, aside from developing a strong work ethic, how are janitors really bettering themselves? How are fast food workers really bettering themselves? How are customer service reps really bettering themselves? It's a job. We better ourselves by expanding our minds, by learning new skills, by eating healthy, by exercising and by networking with others...etc. All of those things can be done without having a job. The reason people would want to better themselves even if the government is just going to take care of them financially is because people generally want to be healthy and happy. Most people want to evolve into the better versions of themselves and live a better life. It's not about how much money you have, it's about how you live and what you do with your time.

&gt; If we put a time limit on how long you can receive this income for, then perhaps it would be somewhat more beneficial, assuming the money allocated was actually used as intended (becoming educated, finding a job, surviving while in between jobs, etc.), since the person receiving the money would (in theory) be more than equipped to enter the work force at this point in time.

We already have that, it's called unemployment benefits. Yes, I think unemployment benefits should obviously be expanded to everyone who cannot find a job and everyone who has to go back to school to expand their skill set, but only until Basic Income becomes a reality. The argument against having unemployment benefits in the future is we are facing a serious job crisis. Every year more and more jobs (even in the service sector) are being replaced by machines. Automation is reaching the point where it is able to replace even complex jobs and do them better than any human ever could. And businesses have every reason to invest in automation. (1) You don't have to pay a machine a living wage or benefits. (2) They will never call in sick or quit suddenly. (3) They will make less mistakes...etc. In the future there just aren't going to be enough jobs for everyone to do. I would argue that now, even if we were to make Basic Income a reality and revitalize the economy, there STILL wouldn't be enough jobs for everyone to do. We don't need to invent jobs for people to keep busy with, and we don't need unemployment benefits, we need a guaranteed income.

&gt; While this may be a somewhat unpopular opinion by some, I would also suggest instituting drug tests for all receiving this basic legislation. Not that everyone receiving the basic income uses drugs, but there will undoubtably be some that do, and taxpayer money should not be used to support a drug habit.

Basic Income is meant to be universal and unconditional, meaning everyone (even the rich) would receive it and nothing anyone could do would make them lose it. It would be a new human right, in a sense, the right to receive your share of the natural resources of the world you were born into. If someone uses that money to feed their drug habit or blows it all on gambling, so what? Let them make their mistakes and learn from them. I think rehabilitation services should be made available to them, but I certainly don't think they should have their Basic Income cut off for spending it in a way deemed inappropriate by the state. Keep in mind this is just my POV on the matter and it is extremely liberal and idealistic. I'm sure if Basic Income ever gets proposed in the United States (or any other western, capitalist country) there would be many restrictions and limitations as to who can receive what and under what conditions.

&gt;  it sounds like we're all basically fucked in our own respective circumstances then

Not really at all. The bankers in a way are particularly troubled because their "predicament" (which they relish in, just like the biggest thugs in the ghetto) leaves them with a lot of power - imposing change on them is VERY difficult. It's a situation where 

&gt; I guess I might choose investment banking over the ghetto. 

It is the obvious choice. Your power over your contextual circumstances might not be much better than in the ghetto, and you will have way less free time than you'd have in the ghetto, but your lifestyle will be order of magnitude better AND you have basically a pass in to heaven if you break out (whereas the ghetto breakout just gets you a shot at working hard).

The main points in a way I'm thinking of are these:      
a) If we just hope that the investment banking culture improves on itself, we'll almost certainly be disappointed. Ditto the "thugs" if you will.       
b) Just moralizing from the sidelines won't do very much. Saying that the bankers shouldn't use obscure facts to make themselves wealthy won't do squat. If drug dealing and being a thug makes you money AND gets you laid, moaning about it and expecting people to rally their willpower to stop doing that (despite the obvious benefits) is ridiculously naive.      

What you have to do is change the environment. It's harder to deal with what gets you laid, but money is often involved in that too, and we can certainly limit how much money can be made by illicit means. Biggest single step here is legalizing drugs, because that'll kill that route completely.

Also some sort of benefits reform would be useful that would massively encourage working and joining the mainstream society (not mandatory drug tests and other bs, but perhaps paying people for good grades and that sort of thing - it's done in some other countries after all and in some areas of the US too)

You know that many doctors take drugs, right? Several doctors have been caught after they botched surgeries while on cocaine to keep up with the pace. 

In fact, there was an article about how many top executives that shit on their workers for not having enough energy have themselves been found to be taking amphetamines. We have caught several of our office workers taking them after random drug tests. Always the big shots who shit on the other workers, too. 

It turns out the typical meth user does it to perform more highly at work. This is exactly why truck drivers were doing this, until they were forced to take drug tests to prove otherwise. Now they can't keep the drivers for shit. They keep the work hours the same as when their workers were all on drugs, then wonder why the clean ones can't keep up anymore...

They dont hate em, they need em. They gut taxes, saying revenues will soar(which only happens when taxes are way too high which they arent)

and then when the deficits pile up they need someone to blame, and its the black woman with 2 kids eating steaks while driving a cadillac to the local strip club to get a tat.. and thats what ALLL of them are like.

America is actually richer than it was when your parents were around. Per PERSON AND ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION we are twice as rich as in 1968. 2 times as much.. and yet min wage workers still get paid less than they did back then. And people feel in theri bones we are poor. HEre is a state in americas the super power, cutting back on fucking tanf? Well WE GOT TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS HUH. and the kochs need a new poney farm for their little girl.


ramble off.. it is a good article and yeah it is hilarious when they have framed the workers of society as living off the good graces of the rich. WE got to give the rich more so they can help all us out more.. SO WE CAN EXTRACT a little of their income to pay for our bread.

But like the article shows its actually the exact opposite. The rich live off our labor hours.  They extract from our work and our calories wealth which they graciously let us keep a fraction of.(and whats kinda worse is a lot of that wealth generation comes from past labor hours which continue to pay the rich..society is slowly seeing the rich live more and more off past labor hours as the means of change gets automated. you know that whole "you didnt build this" that the right flipped out about. But like it or not society is built on the efforts of those who came before us. And I dont care how smart you are, or withdrawn from society.. you dont build shit yourself. Nope all our knowledge and society comes from the past labor hours of our citizens.


Last, I think in especially RED STATES, we need to have a class in HS that teaches people how to be poor and what it is ACTUALLY LIKE. People have this misconception of a vacation, when not only do you make less but you work harder. The poor tend to not have all the modern conveniences. They do their own dishes by hand, they take the bus to the laundrymat. They cant order in bulk .. which allows them to wait for sales. Its expensive and time consuming as all fuck to be poor. 

(edit: felt this needed to be said, and really should be brought up more in this backwards ass states, the idea of banning the poor from buying steaks and seafood, will actually cost teh state a ton of money while not really doing much of shit. They have to redo the entire system servicing stores, they have to train stores, and then do oversignt of stores and strain the food stamp recipients... it used to be expensive as fuck to have our blue laws, as stores and employees had a hard time knowing what you could buy and sell on sundays.. like yogurt was fine, ice cream wasnt.. in my town, a beach shovel was fine, a garden shovel wasnt. Will slim jims be ok? what about tofu steak? fake crab? nah the rigth once again like drug testign teh poor are actually going to waste the states money going after a minority of users problem)

Random drug testing.  Any student who drove could be randomly drug tested because driving was a privilege or some bullshit.

Laws in the US are made by the rich to keep them rich, they love to keep the poor down. Example of this is drug testing people on the dole or welfare.

&gt; Over the past decade panhandler numbers seem to be skyrocketing

This is not the problem, this is a symptom of a larger issue. If that many people are panhandling:

1) There is a lot of poverty. For a super rich country like the US, that means the income disparity is too big (few very rich people, lots of poor ones)

2) The social net is failing. Maybe the financial aid is too little (so people still have to beg even with the help). Or maybe a big percentage are not able to use the social net for various reasons. You can't exactly fill in paperwork if you are mentally challenged, nor pass a drug test if you are an addict. Maybe some people are just ignorant/stupid about the system.

3) People are not receiving the help they need to get off the street. Beggars with mental problems are screwed due to a crappy health care system. Drug addicts are screwed because of the drug war and the general attitude that punishing people for wrong decisions is more important than helping them.

If your community stops giving money to panhandlers, they will just move to another city. You are masking the problem, not solving it. If everyone stops giving, do you think those people will go in a corner and just.. die? Of course not. They'll find other ways to make money, which often involves crime. If they could get a normal job, they wouldn't be panhandlers in the first place.

I disagree because I think the strict drug tests for people on probation is just another tool they use to keep people trapped in the system, and I can't support that. But what I don't understand is these guys are millionaires and have access to the best doctors money can buy. How are they not able to fake drug tests? It's incredibly easy even when you don't have access to the resources they have.

This is a pet issue with the right wing. It allows them to look tough on government spending, while continuing to support an economic agenda which siphons wealth out of the middle class and kicks it up to the one percent. Everything the Republicans do is designed to make the rich richer at the expense of everyone else. And only a dumb bigot thinks drug testing people on food stamps is going to make things better.
