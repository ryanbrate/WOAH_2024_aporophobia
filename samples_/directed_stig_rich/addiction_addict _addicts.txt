Pot laws are changing across the nation. It sounds like if there's a possibility that if he is smoking pot and keeping it from you, that he's at least a functional pot smoker. I have no idea what resources are available to you in terms of treatment and rehabilitation. The latest research indicates that all our current disease models and preconceptions about drug addiction are completely off-base -- that chronic drug use is much less about physical addiction/ mental illness and much more about lifestyle factors, such as chronic stress, poverty, lack of support structures, etc. 

Now, I'm not saying your husband doesn't have support structures. Clearly he does, in you. Lots of drug users do, which is why this new direction of research is so baffling and confronting. We tend to distill things down to a personal level instead of looking at them on a social/ community level. 

Basically, let's look at it this way -- two guys, using pot. Both married, both have children, both employed, and both smoke the same amount and spend approximately the same amount. They live in the same state, so nominally face the same legal risks if caught.

One was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, went to an Ivy League school, and now works for a top financial firm. There are no drug tests at his work. He will not lose his job and income if he is found to be smoking weed, and therefore he is not risking his marriage or custody of his children. His financial security affords him a certain measure of legal preservation, too, as he can afford to hire the best legal representation and post any bail/ pay any fines should he actually have the bad luck to be caught. In short, the most his habit will cost him is a slap on the wrist. It will only ever be seen as an indulgence or vice.

Guy two is your husband. We know his situation. Clearly, his habit is being cast as a moral failing, selfishness, and an addiction. If, miraculously, your family became financially solvent overnight -- you won the lottery, a mysterious fortune was bestowed by a long-lost Armenian relative, whatever -- your husband's pot use would become moot. He would have the financial wherewithal not to have this hung over his head. 

But you know all this. Your problem is the course of action you must decide to take. You have two choices now.

1. Continue to pressure your husband to quit, which you know to be an additional source of stress in this situation. Possibly divert resources to rehab, and risk assets that might need to be kept aside should he test positive again and lose everything.
2. Start researching ways to help him pass the drug tests. 

Now, I'd suggest that you sit him down and talk to him honestly and pragmatically about your concerns, no judgement. If he starts to yell/ defend, don't escalate, just let him run down and then start talking at the point where he interrupted you. Good to have a prepared piece for this. 

First ask him to take the piss test. If he refuses, say that's fine, for the sake of this conversation you will treat his refusal as a positive result -- just as an employer would. Tell him that if he's unwilling or unable to give up pot at the moment, then lying and sneaking around about it isn't helping the family. Tell him that you are his wife and partner, and you put his health and well-being first and foremost. If, for whatever reason, that means he needs to smoke pot to deal with his stress and life situation, then maybe you guys should look at moving to a place where pot is legal, or where he can get a medical card (not really something that could protect him at work, btw). Once he's feeling less attacked/ defense on that front, address the testing issue. Ask what his plan is to avoid testing positive. Do research ahead of time on how drug testers anticipates and addresses the most common tricks, and bring up any arguments or concerns. Ask him what kind of test they use (a piss test, a mouth swab, what?), and plan a response accordingly. 

At minimum, he should abstain from any marijuana for one month, and drink lots and lots of water. That should be something he can commit to, and I hope that since he's continued with his certification and going to work that he has the ability and integrity to put aside pot for one month. 

I think that he shouldn't really be smoking pot at all, since any warehouse accident means a drug test and any pot in his system means immediate termination and that's a drug test/ scenario he can't prepare for ... but one hurdle at a time. Get him past the first test and union certified first. 

And no, I'm not a pot smoker. I'm not even a fan of pot. I personally can't smoke the stuff -- literally can't stomach it. I used to as a teen, but as an adult have developed a bad reaction and can no longer use it at all, which I'm fine with. The culture kind of bothers me, though. Imagine going with your friend to buy wine, and a bunch of giggling women in their mid-30s came through acting like they were so naughty for getting wine coolers. This is what weed is now. 

I was at the weed store with my friend today, and there were a few long-haired toothless men in their mid-30s buying weed. They were making jokes to the clerk like they were still high school sneaking around with their dealer behind gym class and tricking the teachers with their coded slang, giggling at how clever they were. It was like the epitome of the entire pot culture in this town -- thinking it's counter culture as they pay for legal weed over the counter by handing their debit card to a bored-looking retail clerk who runs it through a "wireless atm transfer". 

Anyway, off-topic rant. Sorry. My point is, there's not really a black-and-white morality to this. Your husband isn't a "good" or "bad" man because he smokes pot to deal with what sounds like a slightly-higher-than-average stress load in his life atm (a lot of financial pressure with the union, perhaps an unspoke fear of losing his wife/ child if he fails, financial woes, the stresses of marriage and fatherhood, etc. etc.). There are better ways he could be dealing with the stress, true, but that assumes the time and money for therapy and medication (not to mention the inclination and insurance). Besides, there are also worse ways he could be dealing with the stress. As far as bad habits go, pot is ... not the worst choice he could make. Not the best, but dealable. It would certainly be easier if y'all were wealthy, but then, everything if life would be easier if we were rich, wouldn't it?

So I guess I'm saying ... I don't think your husband is an utter loss. I admire you for standing by your vows. I think that if you approach this pragmatically and with an eye to addressing the situation as a partnership and not necessarily obeying the rules, you'll come out stronger as a couple. There are risks, but life has risks. There are risks no matter which path you choose.

Interesting. I was born and raised in Florida by journalists, and became a journalist. 
I didn't know about the Marchman Act. I have left the state 3 times, coming back for family reasons,
only to immediately plot my escape again.

I would also add that one of Florida's biggest problems is Brain Drain. 

For a state of its size and population the economy is a miserable one horse deal. 

Just service jobs. 

The state has spent close to a century, not diversifying its economy in any real way past tourism, with the exception of NASA which is extremely specialized, and now more or less hobbled. It just relies on its weather and beaches, and selling off the real estate to the highest bidder, slowly killing its natural beauty and wildlife. I remember as a kid when you could practically walk on the fish they were so plentiful. Now all the fucking fertilizer, red tide, run off, and over fishing has killed the gulf. 

Not to mention all of Florida's major cities are poorly planned, and full of corruption, hence anyone young and smart enough to want a career in something other than medical services, food services, or some kind of tourism related job, has to eventually leave to find real rewarding upwardly mobile work. 

Both of its major public universities are in tiny towns, one a fucking swamp. 

If they had one large city with one of those schools in it, it might actually have a city with a young and educated enough center of gravity to be worth living in. All the cities in the US on the up and up have a big school, or one close by. 

Further the tourism economy creates a complete lack of community, and primarily seasonal cash flow, from the wealthy with seasonal homes, rentals, vacations etc. 

With no community there is no real culture. 

When you add to the fact that most of the smart natives leave for a state without its head up its ass, and those who come are either retiring, just visiting on vacation, or running from something like poverty, mental disorder, drug addiction, or in south florida's case, a third world country or fucked up government...

Well you get Florida... and "Florida Man". 

At least my native state is becoming popular for something more than just Mickey Mouse and Grandparents. 

I've always said if I could just take the people, politics, and culture of other cities and states and put in the natural beauty and weather that is Florida, I would have never left.

&gt; Heroin is just something rich people dont do

hahaha.  Dude you are so out of touch you can't even realize it.

Heroin is largely a suburban soccer mom drug these days.  By far the fastest growing demographic, and it's not even close (ok maybe not just women - but suburban high income earners and their children).

Source:  Best friend is an addiction medicine specialist.

The reason: Opiates.   Heroin becomes cheaper than Vicodin at a certain point.

Just because someone is a functioning member of society doesn't mean they are any less of an addict.  When you can blow $2-3k/mo on your addiction and not have it materially affect your financial well being you can go a long, long time without being suspected.  A few grand buys a lot of heroin.

For one, they aren't all retarded drug addicts-I'm sure they make sensible investments when they've made a reasonable amount of money. I'm sure many wealthy actors own mundane things like restaurants, fast food chains, convenient stores, and the like because those are sensible investments. 

Also, they do local theater for which they get paid. And when you have a certain amount of time in a film, you get a royalty check for the rest of your life every time it gets shown on TV, possibly per DVD sale. So, you know, those $8 checks add up.

I'm saying that's where she's at right now with harder shit. It's frustrating to see so many people on reddit who advocate this shit like 'I can handle it so everyone else can'. She is barely in class, comes to school high if she does come, and not just on marijuana. I understand some people just straighten out after high school, but if someone we know dying after a heroin od is not what starts it, and she's probably not going to graduate if she keeps going like this... I have a hard time seeing her turn things around with serious addictions, no diploma, and no wealthy family to fall back on. You say it's the party every weekend crowd but it's really become every day, she is on something. Does that still sound like something I should sit back and watch?

Drug court isn't an option for most and is just a money grab. One of the most common things you hear in NA here in OK is people wanting to say "fuck it" and get high again because there is no way they can pay the exorbitant fees for every part of the program. Thousands of dollars that people don't have but agreed to pay in a desperate bid to stay out of prison. 

I had a guy a few weeks ago share that he was going to go down for twenty years on a small possession because he owed $3200 by the end of the week. This was after staying clean for months, working his ass off at three jobs trying to feed his family but couldn't because drug court was getting it all, and all for nothing in the end. He was going down for longer than if he'd taken the original charge, all because he couldn't pay. 

If he is so dangerous why let him out at all? It's all about money. Didn't matter that he worked his program and turned his life around, he can't pay so he's going down. 

Drug court had potential to be such a great thing. The judge who started it here did so to keep people from rotting away over an addiction, he gave them a chance to get clean and start over. But like everything else it soon became an option only for the wealthy.

RIVAS, Nicaragua—The steady breeze that spins the blades of towering white wind turbines here in southern Nicaragua is helping to shift this country further away from its dependence on Venezuelan oil—and closer to Washington’s vision for the region.

Since 2005, Venezuela’s socialist government has sent $70 billion of subsidized oil to Nicaragua and a string of other nations around the Caribbean, according to Barclays Investment Bank, through a program that secured political allies to help counter U.S. influence.

But in recent years Nicaragua has boosted its renewable energy production, now producing half of its electricity from wind farms, geothermal plants that tap into volcanoes and hydroelectric dams. And its leftist government, an ally of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, expects renewable energy to meet 80% of power needs by 2020.

“We have always said that we can’t depend on the help of just one country,” said Bayardo Arce, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s top economic adviser and a former Sandinista rebel commander during the country’s revolutionary period. “So we began to promote investment in renewable energy.”

Two historical crosscurrents make Nicaragua’s timing propitious: Venezuela is cutting its oil shipments amid its economic crisis and the U.S. is encouraging the region’s shift toward renewables, as it moves to improve ties with the Caribbean. That effort includes the Obama administration’s détente with Cuba and a U.S. congressional bill to open embassies in five regional capitals.

With Venezuela’s economy forecast to contract by 7% this year and facing a funding shortfall of $26 billion, the country has cut oil shipments to some recipients by nearly 40%, according to Petro-Logistics SA, a Switzerland-based consultancy that tracks oil-tanker movements.

At a time when a steep drop in prices could feed the region’s addiction to imported oil, some members of the so-called Petrocaribe program are now taking the advice of the Obama administration and multilateral lenders, among them the World Bank, and investing the savings from cheaper crude into clean energy.

Vice President Joe Biden encouraged such a move at a January energy summit in Washington attended by nearly every Caribbean head of state. Then, during a trip to Jamaica in April, President Barack Obama announced the creation of a $20 million fund for early-stage renewable-energy projects in the region.

“People are using this lull in oil prices to make some serious decisions for their energy security,” said Mark Lambrides, senior Caribbean energy specialist for the World Bank.

The U.S. strategy brought a fierce reaction from Mr. Maduro, who recently accused the U.S. government of driving a wedge with Venezuela’s allies to destabilize his administration. “The imperial power of the north has...gone on to speak to governments of the hemisphere to announce the overthrow of my government,” Mr. Maduro said in a speech.

At a summit of leaders from across the Americas in Panama, he invited others to join Petrocaribe. “Petrocaribe is a guarantee of stability,” he said.

ENLARGE
Nicaragua’s decision to seek greater energy independence predates Petrocaribe.

Nicaragua long relied on imported fuel oil for 80% of its power, a massive expense for the hemisphere’s second-poorest country after Haiti. Nicaragua also lacked thermal plants to turn that fuel oil into electricity, resulting in rolling blackouts that stunted growth in the mid-2000s.

Silverio Martínez, who runs a general store in the farm town of San Jacinto, said intermittent power meant failing water pumps and difficulty washing dishes or flushing toilets. Carpenters, he recalled, sat idle because their power tools were useless. Students studied by candlelight.

But just a few miles from Mr. Martínez’s home, scorching water bubbles to the surface near Telíca, one of 19 volcanoes in Nicaragua, signaling vast stores of underground heat. There are also roaring rivers, sweltering sun and vast fields of sugarcane to provide biomass. To harness all this natural energy, the government in 2005 passed a law providing tax breaks to companies investing in renewables.

The following year, Mr. Ortega, who led the Sandinista government in the 1980s, was elected and Venezuela began shipping his government 11 million barrels of subsidized oil a year. Yet Mr. Ortega, a business-friendly pragmatist despite the revolutionary rhetoric, also has sought foreign investment for renewables.

“Nicaragua has made surprising and impressive progress,” said Alexis Arthur, energy-policy associate at the Institute of the Americas think tank in California. “President Ortega had seen the writing on the wall when it came to dependency on Venezuela’s oil.”

This country of six million people, once racked by civil war, now attracts companies such as Nevada-based Ram Power, which has sunk more than $400 million into the Polaris geothermal plant located next to Telíca volcano, providing 10% of the country’s power. In eastern Nicaragua, a consortium of Brazilian companies is building the $1.1 billion Tumarín hydroelectric dam, which is expected to be completed in 2019 and provide one-fifth of the country’s power supply.

Near the southern city of Rivas, dozens of wind turbines rise up from the shores of the vast Lake Nicaragua that stretches halfway across the country to create a kind of wind tunnel. The result is a strong and steady breeze, without the sudden gusts that can damage turbines, said Javier Pentzke, general manager of Amayo, Nicaragua’s largest wind farm.

Countries in the Caribbean, where consumers pay several times more than their U.S. counterparts for electricity, are also transitioning to renewables.

“It’s somewhat different from the primary motivation of a Denmark or Norway, developed wealthy economies who are doing this as good global citizens motivated by cutting greenhouse gas,” said Mr. Lambrides, the World Bank energy specialist.

Volcanic islands, including St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are moving ahead with geothermal projects. But it isn’t just those that received Venezuela’s cut-rate oil. In Barbados, William Hinds, the government’s chief energy conservation officer, said that half of the island’s power will be generated by solar within the next 15 years.

Fully transitioning to renewables will cost $30 billion across the region, the Caribbean Development Bank has said. But at the energy summit in Washington, Mr. Biden pointed out that the costs for developing clean energy are dropping fast. “There’s an old saying: The best time to fix a roof is when the sun is shining,” Mr. Biden said.

Repeal of alcohol prohibition made it more difficult for people to get booze, more expensive, and harder for [young people to get](http://blog.norml.org/2009/08/28/study-says-its-easier-for-teens-to-buy-marijuana-than-beer/). Taxes on alcohol sales fund education, infrastructure, treatment programs, etc. 

The neighborhood you grew up in wasn't "Fueled" by drugs, it attracted people who were already making bad decisions *because* the rent was cheap. Strangely, fuckups and addicts tend not to move into wealthy suburbs and high rise penthouses.

All data seems to indicate that [spending on prohibition has far surpassed any diminishing returns on reducing rates of use and addiction](http://www.briancbennett.com/charts/fed-data/costs/cost-of-drugwar05.gif), that the drug war and sentencing reforms have led to a [rate of imprisonment in the US on par with north korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate). Even the US drug czar has called the policy a failure. 

How much of the devastation in those poor neighborhoods is because of income lost to use, and how much of it is income lost to imprisonment and the corrosive effects of prison culture on people after release? How much better off would those places be if they had an injection of 1 trillion in infrastructure and treatment?

Dear Agent,

Seventeen-year-old Novi is a grifter with a talent for Illusions. When her brutish boyfriend gets them both into trouble, the only way out is Lukas: a mysterious con man who can see through her magical disguises.

Novi joins his team only to discover that Lukas is shackled to a drug addiction and waist-deep over his head in blackmail. But if they they don't succeed at taking down the mark – a ruthless financier and winery magnate – Lukas may never see his wife again. And Novi will be back on the streets, alone.

Everything goes according to plan... until she falls in love with the mark's family. Someone is going to be unhappy with the results, and now it's up to Novi to decide who.

The Violets of Tavarem is an 80,000 word YA fantasy with heist elements reminiscent of Mistborn and The Lies of Locke Lamora.

Thanks for your interest, and I look forward to hearing from you.

First up, communication is key. 

Communication: How Not to Screw it Up, Nita Tucker

Now the stuff you need to use communication for, to avoid divorce. These are the big issues. 

Money: The Automatic Millionaire, The Total Money Makeover, The Wealthy Barber. (HINT: the idea is to get some money basics, and a reasonable plan, BUT they offer several paths. DISCUSS.)

Parenting: Kids are Worth It. Dr Spock. What to Expect when you're expecting. Any well-reviewed book that covers ongoing maternal illnesses Mom will have, with regards to the duration of pregnancy. Know what you are in for if it happens. Try a little bit from different parenting philosophy. Look for the middle ground and use it as another excuse to DISCUSS. If one of you has an abusive background find *several* well reviewed books on the subject just as a start! 

Family or friend relationship problems: Toxic Parents, if relevant even a little. Boundaries (Christian-y book but you will NEED to understand them. Failure to define and defend your boundaries, your spouse's boundaries and your kid's/family's boundaries will kill your relationships). 

Religion: can't help you here. I'm agnostic, married to mostly atheist. But it is a big source of fighting for many. Don't know your situation OP but it's worth figuring out what book may be relevant. 

Sorry if weird format or word substitution, on phone. 

TL,DR: books will not substitute for GOOD counselling if there is extreme stuff like abuse history, addiction, severe debt, emotional/mental illness. Please get counselling and a second opinion if needed.

&gt; logical fallacy

The difference between "a currently pregnant woman should not be forced to carry an unwanted baby to term" and "anyone should be allowed to do any drug" is obvious, and these discussions are nuanced. The right to bodily autonomy necessitates we don't force women to go through a complicated 9-month medical ordeal, which is arguably and clearly different than the relation between body autonomy and drug legalization. While these are related through that concept, they aren't inextricable by any means. That's a false equivalence, and while I'd love to discuss the relationship between them it's unreasonable to state that I must believe one if I do the other.

&gt; You know about that, right?

Your condescension is rude and unnecessary, please leave it out next time. I do know about this, actually, and it's definitely a part of this problem. 

Specifically keeping women (everyone, honestly) uninformed about reproductive health is an aide in controlling bodily autonomy, and is something we absolutely need to counteract. 

&gt;I absolutely understand the idea that individuals don't always know the risks involved in self-medicating, which is why I advocate consulting with a medical professional of the woman's choosing.

&gt;I don't subscribe to the notion that women (or men) should be treated as helpless incompetents who must be protected from themselves by a Congress and a bureaucracy that's controlled by wealthy white males.
 
I agree with you here. We all understand opposition to alcohol prohibition in terms of "I should be allowed to choose." Yet this idea isn't channeled into other substances in many people's minds. 

For me, it's primarily a challenge of the real world vs. the ideal. Ideally, complete drug legalization with a lack of stigma and wealth of available addiction/dependence resources would be great. The challenges in implementing this kind of a system make me hesitant to push for universal drug legalization at this point, especially when it comes to drugs that (yes, similarly to alcohol) cause direct bodily harm/have a chance for overdose/etc. 

Also at this point, legalizing many hard drugs is simply not feasible, regardless of my personal feelings. Social stigmas and understandings are just too much of a challenge. Though it's starting to gain traction, even marijuana legalization faces extreme opposition.

My first dive into entrepreneurship was at 11 years old. I was the only kid in my community with a color printer and unrestricted computer access. I printed dragon ball z characters and sold them to my classmates for up to a dollar each. I priced super saiyan 3+ photos higher than others. Then, I started printing hentai and selling it for significantly more $. I wouldn't call this a business because it was obviously illegal but I did make a lot of money from it and it allowed me to buy whatever playstation game I wanted.

In highschool I ventured into virtual currency. I developed relationships with wealthy players and turned them into my suppliers. I opened up an online storefront. After burning enough money on ad campaigns, I figured out how to turn $1 ad spend into more than $2 profit. At the time of graduation I was on track to do 7 figures that year then, I developed a couple addictions and that all went to shit. After rehab, I now do business with tangible assets.

&gt; In fact, the opium dens were frequented by both the rich and poor, and one of the unhealthy aspects of that society back then was family turning a blind eye to drug addiction especially when they were rich.

I don't think it is an accepted practice just because it happened. Generally, drug dens are seen as complicated and unhealthy venues, the failure of certain parts of the society to adhere to an ideal society norm does not cause that to become ideal.

To say that this perception is due to media propaganda is akin to saying that visiting strip clubs is a widely accepted and encouraged practice since it is popular amongst the rich and the more complicated parts of particular societies.

Let me say a couple of things to you and I hope I don't make it worse.  

Your family is putting you through school,  do you have any idea how fortunate that makes you? 

These people love you, in a world where money means everything they're willing to spend theirs on you, that is love 

If you feel depressed, you are the reason for it- you are wasting your education,  you are getting high instead of making something out of this great opportunity your family is giving you- when you do nothing in life, when you sit around and get high all day you lose yourself, you're giving your life no meaning and direction.

  A lot of people feel like this but they aren't in your place,  they're in something much worse. Theyre truly poor and neglected and life is truly difficult. 

I don't mean to tear you down but I think you need to hear it- you sound like a lazy drug addict who is looking for sympathy on a problem you're creating.  

" I've been doing what my family wants not what I want " 

Your family wants to set you up for a great life- a life with an education,  with a higher income than what most people have.  Your family wants you to be educated and wealthy,  what was your plan?  You want to do what? 

You need to stop getting high. You need to do your school work,  you need to get up and exercise, take some vitamins,  a lack of certain vitamins can cause depression,  get some vitamin b complex- go see a doctor and tell them how you're feeling.  

I have known many people in depression, not to put you down, but you don't seem to have a reason for it by what you've told us- you want to be a victim but your situation doesn't warrant it 

People love you,  you need to step up and show them you're worth it.  

Get up, exercise, go to class and do your work. Eat better,  stop being an idiot and stop smoking weed. Find a school activity just to have something to do.  

I'm sorry if I sound offensive but it makes me sad that you're digging your own hole and wondering why you're sinking.  

Colleges have therapists,  go see one.  Please take the steps to fix your situation because if you continue on your path,  it's not going to get better and I'd like to see you succeed and come back here and tell someone else that you can make it and it is up to you to heal yourself

&gt; If you play on a high competitive level you play for money.

If you play for money you are playing for fucking peanuts, how many millionaires come from esports? tens? hundreds? thousands. Saying you made money off of it doesnt necessarily mean it was financially beneficial, you have to factor in opportunity costs, which are difficult/impossible to measure. What % of gamers end up playing for many any way? There is more money in poker than esports.

&gt;I also started lifting when I was 17 and I actually had a social life, even when I was sometimes gaming a shit ton. I would still go to parties, have fun, etc.

Well then you managed to do what 99.99% of male gamers cannot, the vast majority of hardcore gamers are unhealthy/overweight and have underdeveloped social skills, your anecdotal evidence doesnt change this (though I am glad you lived a more balanced life). 

Look, I am not trying to say that you should be bawling over your lost youth, crying about wasted time only wastes more time. 

All I am saying is that once you recognize video games for what they really are (an addiction whos cons DO NOT outweigh the pros), gaming loses ALL appeal. It is a complete waste of time.

It is also necessary to accept that you lost a large portion of your youth if you want to learn from your mistake. Trying to rationalize the decisions you made as a child is foolish. You were addicted to a drug.

There are infinitely better ways to reduce drug use than to criminalize their use. For a long time, the answer to the "problem" of people using drugs has been to punish abusers more severely, to the point that now we've got junkies rotting in prison because it helped pad out a politician's resume to be "tough on drugs" back when this was the go-to moral panic in most states (Satanic cults were the favorite in a few others). Now, it'd be wrong to look at that legacy and immediately react by saying "legalize everything and let the Invisible Cock of the Market sort things out!" because reactionary bullshit is pretty bull, and pretty shit to boot. Some shit's too addictive and/or hazardous for a responsible state to not ban, even if it's expensive to do so. There's a case to be made for opiates as part of end-of-life treatment; on the other hand, fucking PCP, bath salts, and krokodil prrrrrobably don't have much social/medicinal value and can cause psychotic episodes, cannibalism, and flesh-melty syndrome, which is a phenomenon in which your flesh melts. That may not be the medical term for it.

Anyway, point is, data IIRC shows that treatment is better for the taxpayer than incarceration (worse for the prison owner, which is a big business now and a social blight in and of itself), and more effective at keeping people clean and turning them into productive members of society. You can create/maintain moral stigma without making something illegal - look at fat people, cigarettes, and fedoras. (Also, not sure why "the state will help me get clean, so I'm going to start using drugs!" would be a thing - most people know that getting and staying clean fucking sucks, and if they don't, that's what educational campaigns are for) Not sure about your analogy of "too big to fail" here, either. Is your point that spending money on criminals isn't worth it? If so, maybe you should remember that drug abuse is itself a crime whose only victim is the abuser, whereas fucking over the world's economy hurt everyone but the ultra-wealthy; this is an important difference in the analogy, IMO. It's also worth noting that, again, compared to the cost of incarceration (both in monetary and social terms), treatment is more efficient - so, yeah, compared to doing nothing, treatment means spending them tax-dollars on addicts. Compared to what we're already doing, it means spending *less* on 'em. Again, this is all going by the studies I've seen, you can look 'em up yourself if you want. The only thing treatment doesn't do is get the punishment-addicts off, and they'd be better served by watching some hardcore BDSM porn than asking us to spend our tax-dollars on sending addicts to prison.

Definitely can relate. Also grew up poor and have done a lot university (did a BA, MA, and now I'm in law school), so I date girls who are always from more comfortable and well-off backgrounds than I'm from. I have a few pieces of advice for dating girls like this, because I've dated my fair share: you've got to learn to let your differences go if you want to keep dating her/them (because now that you're in university there's no way you're going back to the types of girls you used to date or would have ended up knocking-up back home...jk). It sucks, but she'll never understand where you came from and why you might need to laugh at things that would make her and her friends upset - because that's how we all cope. 

But you've got to learn not to sweat your differences. You're always going to be different than most everybody you date. You've either got to let it go now and enjoy the best and most carefree sex of your life, or let it drive you away from what is a great time in your life. But, conversely, you'll never really understand what it was like to grow up where they did. 

Now you're getting an education, which, as you know, is a wonderful thing not everybody else can have. So don't cling to your past and let it ruin every relationship you get involved in. It's (probably) a normal response to be horrified by poverty, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic disputes and violence, etc. Learn to relate to them on different levels and don't think you're superior because of your experiences. Just because you've seen this side of life doesn't mean that their experiences are as rich.

I recommend low doses done infrequently and I would consider an SSRI after MDMA.  I recommend pill testing.  Especially for women, I would consider sports drinks rather than water, since MDMA impairs the body's ability to maintain water balance (which can lead to potentially fatal hyponatremia).   I sketched an answer about preloading and postloading regimens in a response to Borax on this page:  I think some supplements could be harmful, but we don't know yet.

I think we should work with Erowid to run a survey and get a big dataset on loss-of-magic and MDMA use and then see what we can learn from it.   

I strongly support Nutt's research.  If I were wealthy I'd donate, though only after first donating to MAPS, Erowid, and the Heffters.  I'd put life saving or psychotherapeutic research and programs before basic science.  We can wait to make pictures of the brain, but should not wait to get effective methods for curing smoking addiction or reducing end-of-life anxiety or treating PTSD.

He was a young British boy. His parents were crack addicts and smoked while pregnant. He came out with only minor brain damage amazingly. But being a slightly brain damaged child with the name Tedward in Newcastle was a death sentence. 

He was often picked on and beat up. He dressed poorly and always smelt horrible. But in the back of class covered in mom's spaghetti and bruises, he discovered a book on space! He read and read and learned all about space. It was fascinating to young Tedward. And the idea of leaving this cold and lonely Planet in search of alien friends was enticing. 

Eventually Tedwards father left and him and his mother were alone. She cleaned up her act and held down a job for 3 years. Making young Tedward 13. But on a cold winter night she relapsed and over dosed. Tedward was now truly alone.

He moved in with his bitch Aunt and her constant slew of boyfriends. They liked to make fun of Tedward for his acne and unorthodox name. He grew depressed. He sunk himself into his room and read more about space. 

Fast forward 10 years and a 23 year old Tedward is in the military. With nothing to live for and a hunger for adventure and acceptance it was his only real option. 

At first Tedward was a laughing stock. But after more and more hard training. He got himself into shape (and with the power of having something to prove) he moved through the ranks. He became a pilot. One of the bravest and most skilled pilots to ever walk. 

He fought in a few wars before eventually returning back to a normal life.

Now in his late 30's. With no one to love him and nothing to do with his life at this point. He decides to end it all. When he receives a call.. a peculiar call. A call from none other than President John F. Kennedy. There he is. Tears streaming down his face, a gun in his mouth and the leader of the United States in his ear..

"I have a special top secret mission for you, Tedward Sullivan"

He is jetted to Washington in secrecy and is snuck into the Oval office. The president, head of defense, and all the top NASA executives are there greeting him

They all talk. Tedward can't really follow it with his mental disorder but he picks out a few words..

Moon, space, NASA, soviets. 

"Do you understand your mission?"
Says the president 

Tedward blankly stares into his eyes

"You are to fly the space shuttle onto the moon for our country.. for the United States of America."

This is his chance. Why does America want this semi-retarded Brit to land on the moon for them! Don't question it! Shake his hand and agree!

He does. Papers are signed. Deals are made. 

He endures two years of extensive training. 

Tedward calls his Aunt and tells her! She's proud. For once in his life. Someone is proud! Who cares if it makes sense or not. People care! For once he's doing something incredible that people will care about. Millions of people, his Aunt, his dead beat father, his middle school bullies, his comrades from the war, everyone will watch him pilot a space craft onto the moon and make the world proud. 

Today's the day. Him and a few others load in. Cameras on.  Engines on. Launch! They have lift off! As he ascends from the earth and flies into this vast new universe a tear sheds from his eye.. he has made it! 

They approach land on the moon. He prepares to park this machine on this brilliant piece of rock. Neil and Buzz prepare to step on the surface on the moon. 

they land! He did it! 

As he prepares to suit up and go for a moon walk. Neil stops him

"Hey, Ted, look... sorry... but you can't leave the ship"

What! Why! Why is this happening. No one will know he was there! No one will be proud! His bullies won't see how wrong they were to pick on him. His Aunt will think he made it up. He will be a laughing stock all over again! 

"Why!" 

Neil takes a moment..

"Nobody is gonna idolize a handicapped Brit named fucking Tedward"

My family was really weird. Divorced parents, my dad lived on the other side of the country (Switzerland, so it was like 4 hours by train), he was a trader, quite wealthy, and an alcoholic. My mother, on her side, was an artist. She used to do heroin when she was younger, but had stopped. But many of her friends were... special. Drugs addicts, alcoholics, artists, people who lived their lives unconventionally. My mother never paid much attention to me, even though my brother and I were living with her. 

So I have many, many stories about growing up too fast. But here's the day I think really did it for me.

My mother took me to one of her friend's house. A girl I really liked who was maybe 28 at the time, who babysat for us a couple of times. We arrive at her appartment, and it's a small studio appartment, the place is a mess and it's completely in the dark except for one ray of sun that shines through the closed curtains. She's lying in bed, and I go up to her and she's covered in sweat, and seems to be in pain at least to my eyes. And that's because she's quitting heroin. My mother tells me to take care of her while she cleans the place. So here I was, witnessing a drug addict trying to get clean. And I was 8.

I came from a poor family and find it interesting that for the most part this is true.

When I look at my siblings and friends from the area I grew up most are still quite poor, many are in jail, and some are drug addicts (including one of my siblings). The only ones who even come close to being called  "middle-class" are the ones who joined the military or were clean enough (and had a HS diploma) for me to use connections to get them decent jobs.

I am the "the one who got out" (I make decent money and have multiple degrees) considering the area I grew up and my family life (7 siblings, single father making &lt;25k/yr). 

When I talk to my co-workers, almost all come from wealthy families, parents are lawyers/doctors/engineers, most have little to no student loans, and many had parental help with buying their first home. Even my friends from college for the most part come from wealthier families and the ones who did not likely weren't the friends studying law and engineering.

It's interesting to see how different the worlds are between those born with and those born without.

Double edged sword. They also boned investment into alternative energy production and efficiency boosting technology, as per their stated goal to protect market share. i.e. the Walmart strategy of coming back to fuck everyone longer and harder after we're out of options. When their cash reserves have long outlasted the available capital in tight oil extraction (fracking) and the green sector.   

If we're smart we'll partially stabilize domestic fuel prices (yes tax), and use some of the new budgetary surplus to promote industries that help break our addiction to foreign oil. Or more likely... we'll just fuck off all the gains from the improved economy for tax breaks to already wealthy corporations with ties to senior political leadership.

Social worker here...both with protective services and dd. money while doesn't solve all problems it does makes a huge difference. It matters in the community and hiring lawyers if you fuck up. Medical bills are huge...county while great and affordable is a nightmare. If you're an addict you go to the Salvation Army if you're poor if you have the funds you go to Malibu and can spend 500 or more. Money truly does make things much easier. As for empathy most people with money haven't dreamed of some of the obstacles poverty brings.  

The children I worked with where mostly poor and had a lot of the same problems rich kids did coming from shitty families. People with cash had the means to work with the system easier and reunite the family quicker. Most of the poorer children went to group homes. It's the understanding of how nasty shit can get is just something that all the people born into wealth that I know or have worked with can't comprehend.

People dream about having money but no one dreams about being poor.

The rationale makes sense, but the practice becomes an extra voluntary tax on the poor.  States market this stuff like your dollars will go towards good causes like schools and local funds, and that would be nice.  But in reality every time the lottery revenues go up the state declares the lottery a success and *cuts the taxes on industry and the wealthy*.  So basically every time you play lottery you put money back in the pockets of the rich, and all these nice causes are the medium by which it happens.

For example, I'm from Arizona.  The lottery here is to support higher education.  From [2010 to 2013 the state lottery revenue increased from $551 to $694 million](http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20131130arizona-lottery-revenue-funds.html).  In 2014 we elected Gov Doug Ducey, aka an Ice Cream Man, who slashed the university budget across AZ by just shy of $100 million.  So the large part of that money made by the lottery factored into the new budget, for which Ducey was like, "Well shit, we're *overfunded*, let's give some kickbacks to business."  So I think the biggest concern is that the lottery programs indirectly facilitate money flowing upwards by taking advantage of people's addictions, and that's unethical.  Like, a similar business would be alcohol--when was the last time you saw a commercial on the TV saying, "Go out and get drunk as shit tonight, you will be a winner and also save the children/students!"?

A lot of my family come from pretty impoverished parts of Fife and I was amazed that this kind of poverty and mentality exists in a country so wealthy and that has contributed so much to the world.

I watched this documentary, it was interesting but like many documentaries on poverty in this country it seems quite narrow. I'm not someone who believes that people are fully responsible for their own set of circumstances, the government and society etc have a large part, but I do think that often there is a poisonous mentality that exists. It seems that entire generations of families in certain areas believe that the whole world is against them and they will never escape from this poverty, which has probably been reinforced by the horrendous conditions these people have found themselves in for extended periods of time.

This documentary shows us what is happening but not why. It would be interesting to delve into the pasts of some of these individuals and find out how and why they have fallen into their situation. It seems many have the mindset of "I can't get a job because no one will employ me/I don't have the experience". 

Well then why are these people struggling to get employed? Do they have some kind of sickness or illness that precludes them from work? Were you somehow unprepared for life from the beginning? Are you unable to communicate properly with people? How are entire swathes of the country failing to enter the workforce, and how can we help them get into the workforce and stop this from happening. 

Do people need better lessons in managing money perhaps as well? I noticed one guy was living in the dark and using a torch to navigate around, I don't know if his electricity had been turned off or not but I presume not because he was showing us the inside of his fridge which must have been turned on? However I often hear about people living in darkness to try and save on electricity bills, the reality is that it costs about 2p to power a lightbulb from the grid for 15 hours, the costs of batteries and torches would far exceed probably by an order of magnitude of at least 100 times. If he genuinely feels he has to do this then we need to show him not only that he doesn't have to live like this, but he shouldn't because it's probably more expensive!

If people struggle with addiction to drugs/alcohol/cigarettes then we should be helping them to overcome their addictions. I did think it was a bit rich for the guy at the start to talk about coming here because he can't afford to eat as he is rolling a cigarette, sure maybe his tobacco isn't expensive or maybe he doesn't smoke much but it kind of reveals a really unhealthy mentality which has probably been brought about because of the dire situation they are in. Some people seem to be smoking branded, packaged cigarettes which cost what £8-9 in the shops? Surely we could at least encourage them to switch to rolling tobacco? 

If people struggle with debts we perhaps need a central government fund which will help to relieve debt on those in the most dire situations. If it is legitimate debt that has been outstanding for years, if it is unlikely to ever be repaid the creditors will probably accept something like 20-30p on the pound and write off the rest. Or assist people with filing for bankruptcy. Loan sharks should be hunted down ruthlessly and punished severely (ie life imprisonment) because they are often the causes of people languishing in extreme poverty for life.

No drug user goes to prison for using drugs. They go to prison for thieving, driving under influence or something akin to that. You're not being realistic about the actual day to day effects of drugs on the streets. Rich people use drugs casually as a form of escapism. The usual drug user however uses drugs because they did it for a bit and *now they have to.* They also lack the interest in stopping this behavior, which is why rehab has a low success percentage. To fund their addiction, they steal and rob people. You're spewing the leftist lie they excuse nigger incarceration rates with, namely that there are hordes of people in prison for the crime of huffing on a blunt. It's ludicrous.

It's an unusual neighborhood. There are lots of retirees and a significant influx of young people with families. And because of the commute, 520 tolls and its mostly decent access between downtown Seattle and the Eastside it may become a much more sought after place to live. There are clusters of extremely low income housing, apartments mostly, and then stretches of incredibly rich people along Lake Washington. The food scene is not really happening but does have a handful of good restaurants. Toyoda Sushi, Aloha Ramen, Thai One On, Kaffeeklatsch bakery and probably a few others. But aside from those businesses that have realized there is a customer base there willing to spend money (mostly those with views of Lake Washington), it can feel like a wasteland. It can be a pretty nostalgic neighborhood too. There is a guy that fixes watches, a travel agency and a community center out of the 60s. Some of the other businesses never left the 1970s. Occasionally it can feel like a time warp. The Elliott Bay Brewery moved in and seems to be packed almost every night. The Beer Authority is also a popular destination. And if you like weed, well, there is no shortage of medical and recreational pot there. The crime sucks, but it mostly just meth heads stealing mail, heroin addicts shooting up in the porta-potty at 125th and LCW and drunks fighting across from the old fire station. But there really isn't much violent crime. I've only heard of one shooting there, and it was the previously mentioned drunks fighting someone that had a gun. One of them was shot in the butt but was back on the street drinking a few weeks later. And despite the massive housing projects near 145th and LCW, the gang stuff is pretty low key. There is a new skate park going in and the elementary schools that were lost in the 70s are also getting building updates. But by far the loudest complaint from residents is the lack of sidewalks. Its odd because the "downtown" could be very walkable. But walking in the middle of the road just doesn't appeal to many there so they just drive the five blocks to the store.

That's not what he claimed

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Gularte#Early_life

&gt; Rodrigo Gularte was born into a wealthy family in the southern Brazilian city of Foz do Iguaçu, Paraná (state). He was a keen surfer and relatives remember him as a tall, gentle, polite and kind young boy who slipped into depression, and became involved in drugs after his parents divorced when he was 13.
&gt;
His first treatment for drug addiction was at 16, when relatives say they have noticed signs of bipolarity. Others treatments would occur, without success and Gularte developed depression coupled with the use of drugs. His mother Clarisse tried to help him with work. Gularte gained, for example, a restaurant to administer, paid by his mother. He also had a son with autism, born when he was 21, Jimmy Gularte, with whom he had little contact with.[2] But his contact with drugs of all kinds, continued. During his 20's he travelled through Latin America with friends, drinking and taking various kinds of drugs.
&gt;
This embarked him on a frenzy of drugs, sex and rock and roll. Sponsored by his mother, Rodrigo traveled through Latin America to the United States, Africa and Europe - consuming all kinds of drugs. "I thought these trips would do him well, he would wind down, get rid of bad influences," says his mother Clarisse. The result was the opposite. Increasing his addiction, Rodrigo returned in 1994 to Curitiba. At 24, without work or study, nocturnal, Rodrigo was involved in a serious traffic accident after leaving a party, drunk and drugged. To avoid his arrest, Mrs. Clarisse admitted his son to rehab. After six months of detoxification, in 1996, Rodrigo tried to change his life. He became an entrepreneur, but two restaurants of his failed. In 1999, he passed the entrance exam to letters from the Federal University of Santa Catarina. In the middle of the course, he give up. He then returned to travelling through Europe and Latin America bringing in various types of marijuana. In 2004, the opportunity arose to take the stuffed cocaine boards to Indonesia

When you arrive in Taipei there's a sign at the airport that says that "Drug trafficking is punished by DEATH in the Republic of China". My Dad mentioned it and expressed his approval. And he's right - compared to the UK there's a lot less drugs in Taipei and a lot less drug related crime. 

Boohoo this guy suffered from depression. Who hasn't? He had have been executed in Taipei as well - 6Kg is a lot of heroin. You need to kill some drug smugglers to keep the drugs out.

And if you need to make a few blood sacrifices to stop your country turning into a hell hole the fact that he didn't know what was going on makes me think that in this case they sacrificed the right person.

I can't reconcile how a loving God would stand idly by while kids are born into situations where they don't stand a chance, dying of starvation, drug addiction, violent rape and worse, meanwhile there are billionaires living long healthy lives by exploiting and pillaging everything in sight.

I think that if our world was designed to be the way it is by someone who knew exactly what they were doing, that being is a sick and twisted fuckwad not deserving of our adoration.

If God created Satan in order to test our faith, because he wants to know that we will love him unconditionally through whatever trials Satan can throw our way, he's a selfish prick playing games with people's lives in order to see who's worthy of bowing down to him.

A lot had wealthy parents and are in college, partying it up while getting it all paid for. There is this one became a heroine addict and comes to the Walmart I work with and tries to steal stuff in order to return it to get drug money. Worst part is that he is a total nark and he is known for telling cops where certain people are getting drugs for.

We get all kinds of people here, really, and I don't ask for their stories. It's hard enough for some people to come ask for help, so I don't want to interrogate them. I only know why a person needs our services if they want to tell me.

I do hear a lot of stories. We have lots of veterans, refugees (particularly from Burma and Sudan,) people who struggle with addictions, people who were well-off until they got sick or had an accident, people who work full time for wages that aren't enough to live on... We often have new people come in and look at other clients with suspicion, like "I'm not like these people, I'm just here because of bad luck," but I don't think I've ever heard a story I found outrageous or unrelatable.

What do you mean?

I'm just worried because every new RC gets outlawed pretty quick, thats why by far most worthwile psychedelic rcs are by now...

What is getting increasingly popular instead are - you guessed it - rc benzos and also benzo prescriptions.
I see a lot of benzo addicts every day on my way to/from work and what i can tell is this:
Benzo addicts are a bit like zombies, just like alcoholics, but more tranquil.
If any bad happens to them they just take more benzos and forget about it.
The result are people that do not care about anything, won't fight for their rights, won't protest for anything!

Not to mention that benzo addiction is probably the worst of all addictions - so its permanent for many.

I also had to do with a lot of opiate heads, and while they're of course very fucked up people it's nothing compared to benzo addicts.

We live in a global corporate cleptocracy and with so many people either being alcoholics, benzo lovers, senile or fucking stupid, nothing's gonna change!

I'd like to have children once, but not in this world, where you most of the time get fucked over and get your pockets emptied by the rich(/politicians - it's one and the same pack!), so you want your benzos to forget about it.
After all, you can simply get then for doc, what should one do if you're not perverted as the media wants everyone to believe that everybody is?

Finally i do not want to implicate that benzos are bad in general, as i do them myself occasionally - for sleeping mostly - and am also enjoying the chilled out feeling before falling asleep!

edit: TL; DR: do not do too many drugs, especially benzos and alcohol if you want to live in a better world at some point. be prepared to make a change when the time is right!

edit2: too often on benzos and/or booze and you won't even notice when this time comes.


..and i hope it'll come someday so please do not take too many benzos and or booze!

Fine, I'll repeat myself. Say that you're a wealthy CEO. $365,000 isn't going to leave a dent in your bank account, so you decide to bet $1000 a day on CSGL (as an example. We're in the CSGO sub after all) because you enjoy watching the matches anyway. Are you an addict?

It would be great to offer this kind of thing nationwide.  It would be great to offer all kinds of support and services for a number of issues across the nation but it always comes back to the same issue.  HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT?

The country as a whole is running on a massive deficit as it is, where do es the money come from to do this? Please don't say "by not paying to house these people in prison"  The common addicts that we are trying to help here have very short sentences and actually spend minimal time in prison unless they're caught dealing.  

So where do the funds come from when there are countless other issues that needs funding as well? The answer to everything can't be "tax rich people more".

There are good people who aren't wealthy or don't have the uppity careers. If I limited myself that way, I would be shit out of luck because most people I know from a similar background to mine are selfish, spoiled, full of themselves. There are good people from all walks of life and a rich person is just as capable of using you for money as a poor person. Maybe even moreso.  
  
I don't want to date a bum druggie I meet walking in town, but you catch my drift. Lots of educated people can't land their dream jobs and all that. Some people's talents lie elsewhere. I don't know. I just think reserving yourself for the elite is ridiculous and limiting. Look at how few of us gay men there even are. I mean...no one can stop you from having standards, but I will not limit myself. Already have other factors against me that kind of hurt me in the dating scene anyway.  
  
And there are professions that are noble but don't pay well. You would turn down the teacher who sacrifices his salary so he can help inner city kids get the education they deserve or the youth councelor who makes minimum wage but works with charities and programs that help the orphaned children of drug addicts? They aren't worth your time because they aren't wealthy?

Yeah theres a bit of a movement going on. But not to worry, I think things are actually getting better.

The recent times I've been approached by shady people, theres always this community feeling that I can't really explain. 

Its like, they're obviously desperate and suffering, maybe with an addiction. but at the same time, I look in their eyes and I can tell they don't want to hurt anybody or do wrong. Its like the entire community has realized this responsibility and respect for each other that didn't exist before. I think thats why there are fewer random acts of violence, and now crime is more between people know who each other. Its like criminals have a certain respect for strangers now, Its bizarre, but it shows that the city is changing as a collective society. I was telling my friend that the anger that existed in this city, has matured into despair, which is good and bad, but at least its more passive.

EDIT: The best thing you can do to help the inner city if you don't happen to live there: Take your dog for a walk down a busy street in broad daylight. Its adds variety to the neighbourhood, shows compassion, equality amongst poor and rich people, minority and majority, and provides a layer of normalcy not just to criminals/shady people, but also people who just happen to live there, who are for the most part great fucking people who want to live in a great neighbourhood.

hahaha!   Doesn't sound like a good / well respected rehab.  Mine was very expensive and full of either prominent alcoholics or spoiled rich kids on smack.  I was kind of in between since I had a degree and a career but still on the smack... 

Anyway your post reminds me of my time at rehab, we'd all make fun of the kid there for weed :).  Seriously though, your parents just did you so much more harm then good - the naive weed kid learned all sorts of shit about every drug imaginable, and how to score the best dope on the streets of philly, baltimore, chicago...etc... we even did a tutorial on how to get your veins once you've blown em out.  hahaha!  Sometimes people would get on him/the other weed smoking addict so hard, like during the huge coed discussions be all "Hey everyone, my name is laksjdlaksjd and I lost my wife and kids because of my addiction to marijuana... lol nah it was the crack and heroin i'm just kidding!"  Even the counselors and shit would laugh.  

I loved my time at rehab - best decision i've ever made.  Sounds like yours is fucking retarded giving out quel like that, shit was currrency in my block.  I was in detox for 2 weeks and thought i was going to die from heroin, suboxone, 20 mg daily xanax, CT as far as gaba drugs.  But I got phenobarb and quel to sleep - which most didn't get.  Seroquel was the hot commodity;  Getttttin 'quellled out you know.  

At least you're at a compassionate center that gives out strong meds.  As far as seroquel - and probably gabapentin - cheek them and take minimal amounts or none at all.  If you;re not allowed to refuse, that is.

If you "need" someone in your life to be happy, there's something wrong with you.  It may be insecurity.  It may be low self-esteem.  It may be a personality disorder.  It may be social shaming and brainwashing.  Whatever "it" is, you need to figure it out and fix it.

The reason some in the media associated Elliot Rodger with the various online, men centric forums is because Elliot would rather murder people that go without female validation and attention.  The guy could not be happy without a woman propping up his self-esteem and self-worth.  He'd rather see others die than live without female validation and adoration.  You really don't "need" anything from women to be happy as a man.

Your self-esteem, happiness and identity cannot be hinged to something as shallow as a trinket under your arm.  To live this way is to be a fool.  To live this way is to beg for self-destruction.  The biggest mistake men make is thinking they've arrived because they found a good looking women that adores them.

MGTOW is the door to true happiness.  Don't perform like a dancing monkey for women.  Don't improve yourself because you think more women will adore you.  Don't become the best you can be because that might garner you attention from women.

Do things because you mean more than a series of superficial traits.  Do things because your self-esteem and identity are yours to define and control.  You're not someone's dancing puppet.

The path to peace and happiness isn't through the receipt of adoration of others.  The path to peace and happiness is though being independent, believing in one's self and being no one's performing monkey.  The path to peace and happiness is the ability to respect and honor one's self - regardless of outside influence.  

Look at famous actors, singers, and other famous people that commit suicide or dull their pain through addictions.  Were they not beloved and adored?  Why were they so miserable?  Why are so many of the rich and famous miserable people?  Because the adoration, affection and attention of others defines their mental state and happiness.

MGTOW, more than any other men's mindset, is the path to happiness and peace for men.  Do not let the affection and adoration of others define your self-esteem and happiness in life.

It has nothing to do with 'strength' or willpower or 'being a man' or anything like that. The drugs change the chemistry in your brain and make you think you *need* them like you need food or water. Instinctual urges that override your decision-making skills.

You say you need help, so reach out man. What's the deal with your family? Check out meetings. Unless you are independently wealthy they are probably your best bet for structured recovery - support, info, inspiration, accountability, fellowship, etc. 

It's almost impossible to beat addiction alone and you don't have to. Don't feel upset at yourself about this. Help is available, you just need to have the strength and humility to ask.

Corruption exists in every country on earth, it's part of human nature to exploit things for personal benefit. The only un-corruptible FBI agent would have to be a billionaire heir on a blind trust with no political aspirations, no major character deviations/addictions/etc. and of near-center ideology. Such a person can't be bought with money, sex or promises of career advancement. And you don't even have to corrupt the agent, all you have to corrupt is a political appointee a few layers above the agent. Order a 100% case review of the unit and hope you catch the agent doing something dumb, that immediately derails the effort and you haven't even broken the law, all you did was oversight and you caught somebody doing something wrong. So long, mister Agent that actually had a good case going. 

The guy didn't break the rules? Check his boss, anything he does taints the unit as a whole. Clean? Keep moving up, you'll eventually find something. Everyone is clean? Promote the guy so he can't work the case anymore. 

As you move up these supervisory layers politics will play out more and more. For any fed LEO to be able to push a case on a billionaire the suspect would have to be somebody so toxic that nobody in his right mind would dare even entertain deals under the table, losing evidence, plea bargains, etc. Most common millionaires? Turn state evidence, plea deal, maybe club fed, some restitution, etc. I guess it is a function of how much money the billionaire is willing to feed to his lawyers.

 This is such a bunch of horse shit. She clearly isn't ruling in an unbiased fashion, because the facts about cannabis are directly contrary to the definition of the law. Cannabis has little evidence of addiction/dependency and has a myriad of medicinal uses. 

She has only ruled this way because she is a pretentious upper class bitch who'd rather drink wine than smoke a joint.

Urgh!!!!!

Do you have any evidence to prove this claim? Of all the people I've met in *many* different environments over my lifetime, it's always been the rich and privileged white kids who got into drugs most easily. I won't argue that in American society blacks are facing an uphill battle and are marginalized. That part is completely true. However, it's the rich white kids who have enough money to afford severe addictions (and sometimes pay off the judge a couple of times).
