&gt; lol, now that your fallacies have failed you resort to personal attacks.

So this

&gt; Your opinion matters as much as a homeless drug addict who thinks it was aliens.

is not personal attack. Alrighty then.

&gt; posting facts make me part of some operation

You're not posting facts. You're repeating things other people said. Nothing else.

And now you're trying to ridicule everything I'm talking about because it's you who have nothing to say against it.

&gt; I can post links too Russian troll army to brainwash people to support Russian fascism and imperialism Not that I am accusing you of being part of it. I imagine they could do a better job than you, lol. 

Yeah. Go ahead accuse me. Won't change a thing. Because I can't imagine why a person would be so determined to convince me he knows better how my own government works.

Why not ask why they are homeless and spend money getting to the roots of the problem not just the symptom? Are there not enough mental health services and so people who are sick are just left to wander about without any treatment? Same goes for addiction treatment? Or have too many jobs been cut due to businesses closing - what can be done to get enough employment? Have a big portion been physically injured and just needed physiotherapy but couldn't afford it and had to leave work? What are the conditions that have made it so difficult for more and more people to afford homes? If you don't fix the holes in the bucket, you could house 60 000 this year and then next year find there's another 20 000 people, the year after that 30 000 more and so forth.

Most inner-cities have multiple resources for the homeless. Unfortunately, a lot (not all) of homeless have addiction issues, mental health issues, or both and they don't want help. You can try forcing it on them, and you may have some success in the beginning. But most will revert back to old behaviors. 

Story time: A few years ago, this church in the city of Camden NJ (where I work) tried to put the homeless living in one of Camden's tent cities into suburban hotel rooms miles from the city during the cold winter months. It failed miserably. They were forced out of the lifestyle they're accustomed to and were given a set of rules to follow. The police in surrounding neighborhoods started finding homeless men and women wandering down major highways towards Camden. It was a huge problem for a while. 

TL;DR - not all homeless people want help. They've grown accustomed to a lifestyle full of addiction and lack of structure. 

Edit: I don't work for the aforementioned church. I do work in the city though.

I live in Santa Cruz and it's great but also really expensive. There are very few high paying jobs here as it is mostly a service/ tourist economy. So unless you are really lucky you will end taking the 2 hour commute to the silicon valley through a pretty sketchy mountain freeway to be able to earn a high enough wage to get a descent apartment or small house. Their is also a huge homeless problem and lot of hard drug addicts. The traffic, especially in summer, makes even a trip to the store seriously test your patience. Obviously there are upsides to which is why I'm willing to put up with the above but there are major down sides.

It is beautiful, but I would not recommend walking around enjoying the scenery at any time inside Eureka. Everyone is blown away by the beauty of this city, and while they're doing that, they hit a homeless man because he decided to play frogger on 5th Street. I used to work on Broadway and if I worked past 6pm, I was screwed because I had no car and had to walk home. I've been mugged downtown, on Broadway, on the boardwalk, and all in broad daylight. Police did absolutely nothing. But then again, what could they do? How were they going to find one meth head in a sea of addicts to find the one guy that took my wallet? 

I've since moved to a different state and have never looked back. Fuck that place.

Sorry this post ended up being long-winded, but I feel like I can relate and that I've broken out of "the bubble". I'll start by saying that I think this thread is indicative of the fact that you have a ton of potential - certainly more than you realize. You want more, and that's the seed that gets the ball rolling.

I was in a similar boat a few years ago. I'm introverted and prefer my alone time; nothing wrong with that. But I'm pretty self-critical have deep-rooted anxiety and depression from something that happened when I was a kid, and that kept me down most of my life (and didn't particularly help with women, either).

I delivered pizzas to make money in college, and kept doing so after graduating while I tried to figure out what the next step was (I used the "tough job market" excuse sincerely, but it made me complacent and progressed into an easy excuse to sit in my room playing Xbox or watching sports or political shows in my off hours). That in and of itself didn't make me miserable - the lifestyle wasn't particularly challenging and I could feed my video game addiction - but eventually I realized that I had it way too easy (and was way too content) for a 23-year old who had an open-ended college degree and was still delivering pizzas. No one had any issues with me, as far as I can tell (I've always been the "nice guy"), but eventually the realization that I was happy having accomplished absolutely nothing started to eat away at me.

I started looking into ways to get out, which began (in April-ish 2011) with using some of the money I'd saved to spend a few days in the UK (during the Royal Wedding; it sounded like fun). I'd always wanted to go, and instead of letting excuses get in the way, I adopted a "why the hell not?" mentality and was in London a few weeks later. That trip was liberating!

The London trip was expensive, but I took a couple more "why the hell not?" trips that year that were a little more cost-effective - the last space shuttle launch in Titusville, FL and Jon Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity" in D.C with a couple friends. Those experiences convinced me that life is really what you make of it - there was nothing stopping me from doing those things but myself.

Not long after, I decided I needed to get the ball rolling on making my life "purposeful" (my own standard), so I started looking at ways to go about that. I eventually applied to Peace Corps and began volunteer-tutoring K-12 at a local library (6 hours/week) and teaching ESL to immigrants who wanted to improve their job prospects (4 hours/week).

Fast forward a year (the Peace Corps application process takes forever), and I was in 8000 miles away in Tanzania to teach high school-level health in a village with no electricity or running water. I used my personal dissatisfaction (from not having accomplished anything to that point) as a motivating factor, and ended up having a highly successful service. (In fact, it was so successful that Johns Hopkins asked me to extend for a year with them. I'm still volunteering, but I'm doing what I love and my resume looks pretty awesome to boot; I'm looking at grad school next year at either Hopkins or Emory.)

If you'd have told me any of this in early 2011, I absolutely wouldn't have believed it.

So that's me; back to you...

Obviously you're dissatisfied with where you're at. And (most important) you recognize it. Great! As far as I'm concerned, that's potential fuel for getting yourself out of "the bubble".

One of the best things anyone's ever said to me is "you can't choose what life throws at you, only how you choose to react to it" - I don't know who said it originally, but it's a common quote and exists in a number of variants. I'd heard it a number of times before, but one time in-particular was just the right moment for me, and it's stuck ever since.

To this point, you've chosen to deal with life's challenges by beating yourself up. You have a self-limiting attitude, which is just what it sounds like. This is not uncommon; I've been there myself, obviously, and it can be overcome!

Humility and being self-critical can be positive things (this may sound silly to you, but I'm actually reading it as you having a strong sense of integrity). But it can also be damaging if you start focusing disproportionately on the negatives, some of which may not even be flaws except for the fact that you're perceiving them as such. (For example, most women - not all, but most - care less about physical appearance than you seem to think; hygiene is the real key - if you shower once a day and wear deodorant, you're good. Also, while I hate generalizing, women typically prefer to be referred to as "women" and not "girls". How you think goes a long way in influencing your behavior, which is why attitude is so important.)

Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. You're not social; you don't have to be. Some people are, you and me and others aren't. You seem to focus a lot on your weaknesses - again, I've been there - but you should also consider your strengths. (For example, your punctuation and grammar suggest you're a strong writer. Your subconscious can beat yourself up all you like, but it also revealed some talent.)

**(See the bottom of this post; there's an exercise that might help.)**

Another important thing I recommend is taking ownership of your negative qualities. You may share negative qualities with members of your family, but they're still *your* negative qualities and you're responsible for changing them if you don't like them. Blaming your family appears to be a subconscious attempt to reinforce the belief that you can't change; don't limit yourself (easier said than done, granted, but it's on you to try)!

Finally, a more tangible suggestion (*and I think to most important practical advice I can give*): start doing something you think is "purposeful". For me, that was volunteering, so that's what I'd recommend to you. Find something you're passionate about - tutoring K-12, helping out at a homeless shelter or the local humane society, or something else that falls in line with what you think is important. A few hours a week isn't as long as it might seem on paper (and you'll probably add time if you find you enjoy it). It's a great way to build up your sense of self-worth, build up your resume and increase your self-confidence (which helps with women, of course).

Well, that was pretty long. Apologies again. But I do have to get back to work now. Hope everything works out!

**Oh yeah, that exercise I mentioned...**
I want to recommend a personal exercise that helps lay the groundwork for a better sense of identity. It's actually designed for small groups, but it's a cool one that I was introduced to last week while working on a behavior change module we're going to introduce in the next couple months. Your choice whether or not you choose to do it, but it's simple and harmless, so why the hell not?

The exercise: Think about someone you look up to - doesn't matter whether you know them personally or not. Once you've identified someone (or a couple people, if need be), think about what it is about them that you admire. Come up with three personality traits that they that most describe who you WANT to be (even if you don't currently have those traits). Then say out loud, "I am [those three traits]." Don't be afraid to boast!

I don't know if doing it alone will be as effective as it was when we demonstrated the module; it's designed to be spoken to other members of the group to get it "out there", rather than internalizing it. After identifying the traits, we asked participants to walk around and ask each other "Who are you?", following by the trait response ("I am intelligent, reliable and compassionate" was mine.)

If you want, feel free to PM me your three traits or even post it below in a reply for the world to see.

I could make a Craigslist ad saying "College female at this location wants literally anyone" and probably have way too many responses. Sex isn't a rare commodity only reserved for the hottest and the fittest and most successful. Hell, there are probably homeless elderly drug addicts that have more sex than I do. There's people who want to have sex with cars. Find a better example of your desirability.

in 2006 I made my biggest mistake, I learned a new way to prep Kratom. Powder was now popular and I found that I could take Kratom, boil it in Vodka or Everclear and chase it with orange juice. It was fast, potent, and fast and potent! My daily dose was nearing 80 grams a day and I was prepping Kratom this way 5 or 6 times a day. At the time it seemed like a good idea.

In ~2007 my GF cheated on me - at the time I was hurt but today I am sure she was tired of my drugged up life. I found it by accident while playing with a network packet sniffer. I was playing with it at the same time my GF was IM'ing her other man and I was able to read their entire conversation in real time. We broke up only to decide to try again. Which was a bad idea as it did not work out. We separated for good.

I met someone new very quickly. She was to this day the love of my life. Life felt "happy" again, but it was only because I was a living zombie on the verge on my first melt down. I lost my job and it was now time to quit. My GF supported me as best she could but my big mistake was now something that could not be ignored. On the 3rd day of a cold turkey quit it was not the Kratom that was the worst but the fact I was drinking daily, all fucking day just to take my Kratom. I was suffering full blown DTs from quitting alcohol. I was hallucinating monsters, paralyzed with fear, shaking violently and unable to control my own body when my GF came to check on me. I was rushed to he hospital and admitted. I was kept in for detox and released after 6 days.

I said I was done with kratom and I would stop drinking but I was unable to make that happen. My GF was able to stay with me as I slowly crumbled trying to get my drinking under control but it was a losing battle. She was unable to watch the man she loved slowly kill himself and left me. This was the trigger that started the meltdown. How I managed to be functional at work I do not know, but I did - for a few years. I picked up Kratom again thinking I would use it to quit drinking but just found myself addicted to both.

Addiction to both quickly got to be too much. Work started to crumble. Soon I lost my job,soon after that I lost my home, soon after that life was so blurry I can not even tell you what happened... I really have NO memory. All I remember is one day I was homeless, starting to detox and one of the other homeless people I was hanging out with noticed I was beginning to withdrawal and he gave me a bottle to fight off the effects. I thanked him for it and began walking to the hospital. I sat in the waiting room for 13 hours and was out of alcohol and starting again to withdrawal when they called me back and gave me a shot of ativan. I was admitted, detoxed, and referred in to a treatment program.

That was 2 years ago and since that day I have not drank alcohol again. BUT i started Kratom up and was taking it until 15 hours ago. I tapered down from 120grams a day to 30 and made then made the leap to 0. I have done this before and know what I have to look forward to and I did my planning. I have a half ounce of weed, clonidine, Tramadol, Icy hot back strips, OTC pain killers and imodium. My goal is to take as little of anything as possible and so far so good.

Update: Day 4 and feeling so much better. I am back to my workout routine, no more aches and pains, sleeping 5 or 6 hours, sex drive is back up, mood is much improved. Unfortunately cravings are still knocking, but I feel good having made it through the worst without breaking. I will say if you can get clonidine from your Dr, it is worth a shot. Just tell them you are quitting smoking and kratom and you need something to help you with sleep and anxiety so you can keep your work and sleep schedule (add in something about how you tried to quit but sleeplessness had you unable to keep work up - also ask if they have any follow up information for you such as addiction specialists or recovery programs). It was a HUGE helper for the restlessness.

This time I am done. I have spent too much time rebuilding my life back up to fuck up and be here again. I will put Kratom next to Alcohol on my never again list.

That isn't the point. Your place of business cannot, under any circumstances, become a destination for the poor and homeless. For every poor family down on their luck trying to get shoes for their children there's a drug addict who will stab your employee if the trash doesn't contain what they wanted that day and they're having a bad trip. If they begin to congregate even a tiny bit, they start to scare away paying customers.

I understand why people feel that way, but you have to consider situations from every angle. A store might even donate some of their waste to charity, but they still can't have the homeless at their dumpster.

i've lived in Sunalta for almost 20 years, i grew up here, went to school in the neighborhood, and I'm still here. There's some great buildings to live in, and some dumpy dingy ones. There's some beautiful houses, and some dingy ones that will probably get torn down anyway. You have a mix of everyone living here, from recent immigrants to students to business people, single people, young families with kids, older retired people...etc.

When it comes to issues in the neighborhood, there are some for sure. 

* Car prowlings do occasionally happen and I've had my car broken into once, as has one of my friends who also lives here. It's a good idea to not leave anything in your car. I know people have had their tires slashed too. But that's once or twice in the last 20 years. 
* We get a fair share of drug addicts and homeless people lingering around, especially closer to the liquor store off 14th, but really I've never had any issues there. I've gotten used to them and they don't bother me. You tend to see the same group anyway tbh...(some of them I know by name, which usually gets them off my case if they ask me for money. I just chat them up and talk to them like anyone else, and they leave).

* Drug dealing happens in the neighborhood, you'll see sketchy looking dudes riding around on bicycles going around the block regularly or you will sometimes notice cars (usually rentals) coming and going, or idling in the alleyways waiting for business. There was a time when this was happening a lot more than I see it these days, but it still happens. 

It *can* be a little loud off of 14th Street, and people can get a little loud on 14th Street on the weekends, but I've never had any problems with anyone, and IMHO wouldn't call it a "rough area" as someone did here. just be aware of your surrounds as anywhere else. 
However if you're not used to the noise, it can be **loud**. It's much much louder than the suburbs.

But it's a great place to live. it's close to everywhere, it's very central, for me personally anywhere I need to be is max 15 minutes away. 17th Ave is around the corner, tons of stores and bars and stuff if that's your thing. Everything is walkable, which you can't say for a lot of the new suburbs. I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world. I love not having to drive if I need to go get groceries. If friends are doing their birthday at any bar downtown or off 17th, I don't have to worry about driving, because I can walk. 

i love this neighborhood, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a residential neighborhood this close to downtown. you get a bit of residential living with a bit of inner city living. i personally would not hesitate to buy here as long as you know what you're buying and are comfortable with the area :) hope it helps!

Wasn't there a documentary where they gave a homeless guy tons of money and he just went crazy and bought tons of things only to not be able to afford it in the end and ended up homeless again? A lot of them can't grasp the "working life" aspect or arnt fit for it. Drug addicts aren't gonna stop having problems with thousands of dollars handed to them.

Homeless addicts are less likely to value their own lives than people who are well off. I don't think that's open for debate. He gave access to drugs to people who had the resources to get help if necessary.

*Don't ever give homeless people money.* 

Most panhandlers are totally normal people. They come into the city and make 20-30 bucks a fucking hour preying on people's good nature. The rest are drug addicts and alcoholics. You want to help? Donate to a charity or a shelter. Overpay on your taxes.

Same. Here in the UK the only people who sleep rough are those who refuse to forgo their addictions (usually heroin or alcohol) so they can use the homeless shelters and hostels.

Used to work for a fast food chain and there were a group of smack addicts who would sit outside and when folk bought them food they would come in and try and get a refund so they could get cash for drugs.

I fucking despise beggars and I would never buy or give them anything. Perhaps advice at a push. "Spare any change for the homeless?" My reply? "Change comes from within, buddy".

I'd encourage everyone interested in substance addiction—especially heroin—to check out the book Righteous Dopefiend. It's got a lot of photos like this, but all delves really thoroughly into the societal factors that impact heroin users' lives, and offers insight into systematic oppression against homeless drug users.

Thanks for the kind words and detailed reply.  I am not annoyed with an interesting thought experiment, but I must confess that yes of course I disagree that I am a libertarian, and have given it very careful consideration both now and in the past.

I agree that a lazy bum has the right to food, nor would I put quotations over such a right.  Everyone has the right to food, if you ask me.  As far as sequestering in a socialist system, well of course we should not equivocate the camp survival hypothetical with a socialist society hypothetical.  First of all, yes the community can absolutely (and in some cases have the responsibility to) isolate people that pose a clear and present threat.  People that lack empathy in the very real sense of the word (not just dicks) such as psychopaths I hope we can agree are capable of tremendous damage to others in many regards, not just hoarding and being lazy.  So under a socialist system I should hope there would be excellent psychiatric hospitals, where unfortunately there are some that would be held there for their own good as well as the good of society.  So let us separate the lack of empathy people that suffer from serious mental ills with the common garden variety selfish dick.

To deal with the lazy, loafing dick, there are many means of encouragement, and I would of course never suggest that any kind of violent punishment be one of them.  One point I have often stumped my more conservative friends and family members is the case of the petty criminal that is not mentally ill.  Many (all?) petty criminals have had the back luck of being born to poor families that often have many problems--an alcoholic and physically abusive father, a junkie sibling, etc.  These people often see no alternative than to turn to crime.  In say the USA a petty criminal, once arrested, their life is only made more difficult.  If they commit a felony it is harder for them to work, there is a huge social stigma, they face debt for bills left unpaid while they are in jail, etc.  Going to prison only digs them deeper into the hole of poverty and hard times.  When they come out of prison the are not rehabilitated.  So here is my question to those that would suggest further punishment, more prisons, more police, more oppression as a means to solve poverty.  Would you rather give your tax money to pay for prisons and police, which in turn further this vicious cycle of poverty?  Or would you take the same resources and pay for a modest home and education/training program for criminals?

Why not pay criminals *not* to be criminals?  You give a petty criminal and their family free housing, free education, and access to basic but good possessions like clothing, a computer, books, etc., you take away their motivation to continue being criminals.  And if there are those that still choose to be criminals even after being given all this, we collectively as a society can say with at least some level of accuracy that they had no excuse to turn back to a life of crime.  We can then rely on game theory (i.e. [Tit for tat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat)) to sort out the repeat offenders as a more efficient strategy for prisons in a socialist society.  Criminals are put in prison but the focus is on rehabilitation: mental issues given therapy and/or medication, addictions treated, education given, special needs accounted for, etc.

So okay, let us say that a lazy bum dick is not a criminal in a socialist society either.  They just want to eat, sleep, and chill out in their nice, rent/mortgage free home and play video games all day.  How long can one really do that?  Humans are curious creatures and social by default.  I would suggest that dicks are dicks for a reason.  They perhaps didn't get the attention they needed in their formative years as children from their parents, so now they will take any attention they can, negative or positive, and create drama in order to create negative attention as their inner child may require.  Who wants to hang out with selfish dicks that are loafers?

They end up sequestering themselves.  And perhaps they need to.  Some people need longer, for reasons just mentioned, to work out existential crises.  I say in a socialist society, let them.  I am fine with having society's labor provide them with the basics to sort their lives out.  And really how many people do you really think are going to be life long lazy bum dicks?  My guess is that eventually these sad creatures would get sick of being lazy, and the encouragement of a creative society that is not driven by profit would eventually motivate them to do something with their lives and by extension give something back to the community.  If anything, nearly all people crave intimate relationships because we are driven to reproduce.  Who wants to raise children with lazy bum dicks, or even be lovers with and waste their time with these kind of people (at least for any extended period of time)?  There are natural, inherent checks and balances for lazy bum dicks.

In a socialist society no one would be thrown to the mercy of nature, no.  Effort would be made to do as much as possible to discourage lazy bum dicks, because remember that ultimately socialism is striving to eventually get to communism.  Effectively and I would suggest with as much empathy as possible, giving lazy bum dicks the opportunities to be productive and happy members of society would perhaps be one of the big challenges of the transition from socialism to communism.

There is another big aspect here that has not been included in this discussion either, that makes the socialist society all the more plausible if not preferable: technology.  It may be the cast that in our lifetimes, we will have to means to achieve more or less full self-sufficiency through technology.  Let's say I buy a small plot of land out in the countryside with a small group of family and friends.  Now let's say technology reaches a point where robots are ubiquitous and affordable.  Now we have the labor of the robots to "exploit" on our collective.  The robots plant and grow food crops, clean up our homes, help us build new homes, build and regulate solar panels that power the collective, etc.  There will be a point where members of this collective will no longer need to resort to wage slavery.  They will quit their jobs to be lazy bums on the collective.  But I would imagine after taking a long vacation chilling out on the collective, drinking robot made beer from robot grown barley and hops, and enjoying the company of the other people on the collective, people would get bored and want to create things.  Art, more technology, whatever.

Now imagine if everyone started doing this.  We allow capitalism to sell the means of its own demise to us.  Remember, they will have to sell the robots as cheaply as possible to maximize profits, and the robots will have to be of excellent quality otherwise some other robot company will run the show.  Just like everyone has smartphones now, perhaps in 20 years everyone will have a robot assistant.  Combine that with renewable energy, 3-D printers, and better and better computers, a critical mass of self-sufficiency could eventually be reached.  We'll all take care of ourselves, and socialism will be all the more natural a step for humanity.  But I digress...

I hope that this further clarifies my vision and interpretation of how a socialist society should operate, and what to do with both dangerous people and lazy bum dicks.

You can insult me all you want. Thats just another sign of your inability to make an argument. (calling me a pedophile is really low)...Those assumptions you make on a personal level are ridiculous and childish. (you continue to "sound" like a teenager w/ poor education)

If you really want to know I have degrees from one of the best Universities in the World...if that matters at all. And do very well at trading, thank you very much. My employees are very grateful too.

As for the theme in question: take that view you have of the "dark ages" to a reputable History faculty and then see how professional historians laugh in your face. Make sure to print your wiki source....

You saying you know about History is an offense to professional Historians such as Le Goff (and many many, many others). 
When someone speaks about a subject it doesn't mind if we are in a classroom, lecture or on the park benche...science is science. You don't get to extract what you want from sources and say "i'll take this and that literaly and that i won't".

(in simple terms:) The term "Dark Ages" might have been inittially coined as a pejorative in past centuries either to try to explain a "documentless" era or to try to shine on a more classical perspective of the world and to diminish the importance of the "old" societal structure. 

Historians classify the Middle Ages into Early, middle and Late Middle Ages. Even in the Early Middle Ages we have figures like St Augustine, Justinian, the Franks, The big rise in monasticism, The Caroligians and Charlemagne, etc etc etc. There is no darkness in it, other than exixting less documents than i later epochs.

All throughout, the Catholic Church suffered changes back and forth, being ever more entrenched by the rulling families (wich is why the Monastic Orders were so praised: made mostly out of devouts, not 2nd and 3rd childs looking for employment). But the Catholic Church enhanced science and philosophy forward (in fact, practically all of the great thinkers benifited from the translations form the Classics made by the Monastic Orders...where would we be today without them?). Several Popes subscribed it: even the one that let Galileo be wrongfully charged.

All the meanwhile, the Church ran countless schools, nurseries, workshops and feeding programs all through the centuries. It gave people a spiritual and moral guidance that went beyond the ruthlessness of the Imperial society.

And much much more could be said. And of its mistakes as well.

So i sugest you read good academic books and leave wikipedia and the History channel for the children.

As for the current century: have you ever seen a catholic nun picking up dying children from the ground and taking care, like a mother, in places where the UN is nowhere to be seen? I have.
Just last month i was in a catholic group trying to help and console dying patients in oncological wards. A group that has been doing this even before i was born.

Priests consoling the ill in public hospitals; nuns running nurseries for poor and low middle class citizens; Monks working with gypsies - a group that many people don't care about -; priests giving food to numbers and numbers of homeless and elderly poor ; priests-surgeons who make surgeries without charging (the same for doctors-priests); nuns who check on the elderly every day cleaning them and repatching their medical supllies and wounds; priests who run schools for poor muslims (taking them form extremism); Resting homes run by the Church,where the State has none; priests and monks who worked with the drug addicts, with single-mothers, with mothers running from family violence, Priests helping kosovar children from all religions when all hell was breaking loose...afghani children...etc,etc, etc, etc, etc,etc, etc

If this is a reality that you don't know i suggest you get acquainted with before you make hollow remarks.

Or the shelters are super dangerous. I know a lot of women will choose sleeping outside over a shelter because the rape rates at the latter are so high. 

And people with addictions are often barred from shelters as well, which totally makes sense considering the incredibly high rates of addiction among homeless people.

I don't really care if the homeless guy I give money to spends it on booze or drugs. I would like for him to get clean, but addicts can't just quit then and there without physical repercussions, and I'm not some puritanical morality police. If I feel compassion for someone, and I have some small bills, sometimes I give that person some money.

Also, most charities (especially religiously affiliated ones) have terrible inflated overhead, and most of your money is going to be wasted. I don't want a goddam red cent of my money going to some homophobic asshole who's going to preach hate to his insipid congregation. Honestly I would much rather it be spent on drugs than donated to a church.

And I didn't say it was. I was speaking specifically about Class A drugs. And no I do not, as I said I feel that the war on drugs is justified as drugs can destroy lives. And yeah of course they could be, but Class A drugs of course have an extremely negative effect on the body, even lower class drugs such a ecstacy can kill people.

What is your view on the issue surrounding drug misuse / abuse? Do you believe the current system is fine as it stands or would you propose significant changes to the way drugs are seen and drug abusers are treated, examples of these changes that come to my mind are:

 The legalisation of minor lower class drugs with proper regulation and moderation, perhaps even taxation like we see on alcohol &amp; tobacco. 

A change in the way addicts / users are treated and/or punished in society, due to the prison system often leading users to find stronger drugs or return to drugs upon release from prison due to very little rehabilitation. Essentially treating addictions as a health problem and not a criminal issue. This could give law enforcement more time to focus on the larger suppliers / importers of dangerous drugs.

Think of it this way, how could that dude bring up the courage to drill arround in your teeth and shaping them with lasers and shit. I would probably puke in the patients face lol.

I hate my parents. I'm 19 and have no friends or social life, and everyday I want to pack up and leave. The idea of being able to just roam the country, even if I was homeless, is so much more appealing that being stuck at home with a pair of emotionally manipulative, arrogant, controlling stress addicts who have no idea how to maturely handle a situation. But I worry about what my mother might do if I left, plus I have a dog and would hate to leave him with them.

And it's a little demeaning to the homeless as well, no? They're not animals in a zoo; they're human beings. It's weird to make a sign like "don't feed the fish!" I can't really explain *why* it feels so wrong, it just does. With not feeding an animal or whatever, we know it's in the best interest of that animal, so it doesn't get sick. With not giving money to a panhandler, it's sort of like saying that, no, we know what's best for them, it's not money, so put it here. Are they going to come back and help those specific people who didn't get money because of this sign?

Plus, it doesn't matter if they want money for new shoes, food, booze, or drugs. They're still people. And you know that they might not use your money in the way *you* think is best, but it's still your choice if you want to give them money. 49/50 people could go and use that money to fuel their addiction, but who cares? The money was given freely. I dunno, the sign just irks me.

Addiction is like a balloon - if I squeeze it in one area, the other areas get bigger!

I don't know you, but you admit to being a benzo addict who still gets high with alcohol and street drugs. It seems like you "squeezed" the benzo part of the balloon and the other areas  bulged out - the cocaine, the strippers, the drinking, etc. 

I'm really worried that you write, "[i]t doesn't affect my day to day life," yet you lost a girlfriend "due to this issue mainly" an you're "more easily irritated." Those sound like day to day issues to me. 

Any mind or mood altering substance can be devastating to my life. My story doesn't include cocaine, but I don't have to try it to know it's a horrible idea for me. I have plenty of "yets" in my story, and you probably do, too. I've yet to use certain drugs. I've yet to be homeless. I've yet to die from addiction, but all those things can happen. 

If I'm asking myself if I have a problem, I probably do. Normal folks don't wake up one morning and thing, "am I using too much dope?"

Ok but norway is leaps and bounds richer than the rest of the world in purchasing power. When you can make a living on minimum wage, you cant possibly understand how shitty it is to be 30k in debt halfway through your mandatory career path's university education, have 2 jobs but not working enough hours to move out, and almost zero medical insurance if i were to move out, no dental insurance, no eye insurance, even on my parents' plans, who both work and make decent money (read: combined, still 50k less combined than the average 1 person's wage in norway) and can barely afford to live in the house my mom and my grandma and i were raised in (i pay my own bills but just not rent if im in school)

And still you get looked at like youre a homeless crack addict for not living on your own. And still cant bring girls home unless she's your girlfriend because your mom wants to make friends and be judgmental at the same time. And you still cant even have w computer in your room because this is a family house. But at least you can afford gas money to drive to school for the degree that might never do anything for you!

You should watch "through a blue lens" and gain some perspective on addiction.  Also most addicts are not homeless, and there is more than their addiction that caused them to get to that place.  Sure the addiction helped, but its not the whole story.

It is extremely important to include poverty, class and racism when talking about addiction. A majority of "crackheads" suffer both lower-class circumstances and racism or abuse. You cannot know what has caused someone's life to get to that point. If you have a problem with homeless people in Victoria I suggest you move elsewhere. Until the city (and the rest of government) acknowledges a crisis going on where people are becoming more and more incapable of surviving, a greater police presence, as stated above, will only move down the block.

I don't think that's true. I want it to be true but I'm pretty sure it's $15 downtown as well. 

Look at it this way, I've got one crew, and I'm about to have 2 more local connections, and one in poco. I'm 2 hours outside of Vancouver then there's going to the hot spots in the DTES. I WILL DO THAT, I will experiment, but as an every day thing? NO. 

I did tons of research and read about the history of our DTES once during a dry peroid for me. I read comments from  drug cops saying "it never moves far from here" there's  a corner so famous it's literally reffered to as "the corner' all across Canada. There's some parks, there's "the corner", and some other hot spots for open air drug dealing. But it's dicey, you can get bunk, robbed, you can get middlemaned and taken advantage of. 

At least with the guys out here I have a relationship. 

Would I like to buy a gram for $100? YES. But when I was getting a gram for $160 it's not that much different and it was quality. 

Again, I can't travel 2 hours every day just to get dope. or even often. But trust me the day I experiment i plan to hit all the spots I read about. I've seen ONE SINGLE  MENTION OF "Everything is $10" just one. 

The history of the DTES is funny, all the cops and city have done is force it all outside, making it more dangerous. See... it all used to take place in a number of small cafes and various run down hotels and such, but they've pushed most of that outdoors. 

And say one day I get idk... a half gram for $50 instead of 3 points, that's great. But do I take the bus for 2 hours every time I run out ? do I spend $300 a a time? ANNND anyone without a phone is someone that's probably a small time addict running drugs for someone else, surely they want a cut. 

Tho I read about a lady that runs a lot for people and she takes a cut of $5 here and there. small time junkies that aren't greedy like that I could work with that...but even if I go downtown and find the right dealer I want a PHONE NUMBER so I can reliably get off him  again and again. 

For all we know one of these new connections I've been given or am about to get will cut me great price breaks or sell to me in bulk. 

There's my good friend hooking me up with guys that sell so much they're a little scary. The old hippie I sell hash to is going to introduce me to a local guy selling out of his house , a place I can actually drop by,...and I offered him 4 grams around the 15th from my job just to introduce me, and there's a new local phone number that homeless lady gave me, who knows if that guy is doing 3 or $50 seems all the subburbs peeps are but maybe not. 

I'm honestly more excited about the new connections I've made and will be making locally than going to the DTES while at one point when my reg crew was disappointing me I was more excited about the DTES.

But I have both numbers now. The last time I tried to get the other number for my reg crew a crack head told me basically only if you throw in for crack with me. I could have asked my main guy that's been there for the old and new management and who I've bought off the most but most of the time the number I use is on. 

Fuck, of course when I want 9 points they have one fucked up line. But that's ok now. Now I have both numbers and the only thing that will hold me back is when they're actually out and not just lack of phone time , technical problems or whatever.

In my area it wouldn't work.  

When you look closely at the homeless who live outdoors in our cold winters despite there being emergency shelters open, you find people who have serious mental health and or addiction problems.   We cannot force someone to get mental health treatment or addiction treatment who doesn't want it.   Shelters aren't equipped to manage the behavior of the seriously (and untreated) mentally ill.  Shelters don't allow people to actively use drugs or drink, and the addict chooses his fix over a warm bed.  

I'd love to see a major overhaul in the mental health and addiction services.  I bet it's far cheaper to offer free good quality mental health services and free drug rehab than it is to police the crime caused, incarcerate these people,  and to suffer the harm their misbehaving causes on society.     

Right now a poor person having a major mental health crises goes to their local hospital er, stays long enough to be put on some medication to manage the behavior, and they're released.   No follow up for the meds.  No meeting with a therapist.  If the meds don't work that well, in a few months they'll be back in the er or jail.  If they do work, medication compliance is a huge problem: patient feels he's not sick any more and meds are expensive/inconvenient.  Patient stops taking meds, and the behavior degrades again. 

And even with insurance, patients have to deal with under served areas and waiting lists to get into rehab.   In my county if you're on medicaid the medical insurance carrier doesn't cover it.  It's handled by a mental health plan which contracts out one or or two clinics.    There might be a wait of a month for a new patients first appointment.    And if you're homeless (no addess) or not thinking clearly (mental illness/addiction) you're not going to have any coverage at all.

I don't want to get too far off track, but since you seem to be an expert  can you explain why people are homeless then? For example, if only a VERY tiny percentage of homeless people are drug addicts, then what is the cause? Are you saying that they are lazy and simply don't want to work instead? Are you saying perhaps they are all alcoholics? Please, to help me judge them more accurately state the major cause of homelessness, then stop to consider if that persons actions may have had any part of it.

I love how defensive he gets when people point out his ignorance or hypocrisy in situations.

Yes.  It has to do with agency law. An employee is considered an agent of his employer, so if the employee does something wrong, the employer is the one that get sued, and they will lose.  Drug addicts steal form their workplaces, everyone knows that, but if they were given access to a customers information, and stole form the customer, the employer would have to pay for it.

Also, workmen's comp.  An employee gets hurt at work there is insurance that takes care of them, and will pay for pain pills.  But, the cost ultimately comes from the employer from higher rates.

IMHO, this is the primary reason why there is such pushback on the idea of drug testing welfare recipients.  If someone's a druggie it is in everybody's best interests to give them welfare and a trailer in the stix, it keeps them out of trying to interact with the rest of society at a far cheaper price tag than putting them in prison.

A lot of people don't naturally have empathy for people with different experiences than them. Look at all the people who assume poor people must have done something to deserve poverty. Then there are the politicians and public figures who will rail against X (abortion, homosexuality, addiction) until a relative reveals X and suddenly the person is making public announcements about how he now understands that people with X aren't monsters but need our support.  These people are probably warm and loving with people close to them, but make no effort to understand anyone outside their narrow experience until someone close to them forces the issue.  Having little or no empathy probably makes life seem more straightforward and easy to understand. I know it works that way with my sister, who sees things in very black and white* terms and ignores any factors beyond fallout from personal decisions. (*not racially -- she just doesn't do shades of gray or nuance.)

Crime is all about risk and reward. The higher the risk, the higher the reward. But thieves always look for low risk crimes that offer some reward. Bike theft is such that. It is basically labeled as a petty crime and police rarely investigate. Most bike crime is committed by drug addicts, homeless, or just people down on their luck looking to make a quick buck. They dump the stolen bike for 5-10 cents on the dollar, weather it's a beater or $2000 roadster. But there are professional thieves who target expensive bikes, cut the U-lock with the right tools, and take a van ride to another city to sell (usually about 10 bikes would warrant a trip out). No way they can sell locally as they'd be had. But these thieves are not in high numbers because it takes a lot of overhead and storage to transport bikes to a new city. 

The main conclusion here is that bike thieves are just assholes.  I wish you the best of luck finding your bike. 

Edit: btw, that's a sexy bike.

You have to take in account that all of our sources are filtered by three generations of Aladins dinasty propaganda and totalitarism. According to foreing historians the Sultans had troubles with social discontent before Alladdins apearance. Food shortages and militar reprehension were comon description on those times. But also opulenc3 by the sultans as big palaces and privete exoctic animal zoos. Feeding a tiguer could use the meats necesary for twelve srarving homeless people. The sultan and his best man Jafar made a plan to create a new type of monarchy that would win social aceptance among discontent population by a facade of "peoples goverment" while at the same time maintaining the sultan privileges. The myth of Aladdin, the common boy who by magical means and a good heart, marries the princess and becomes sultan. The problem arrived when princess Jazmin found out of his father treachery to used her and marry an uneducated boy. They finally agreed that they will find a situable prince that would pose as a street dweller for some time and then marry the princess. Prince Ali was found from a good ascendence but bankrup enough to follow the sultans plans. We know thi history because Jafar was exiliated as soon as Prince Ali was found since therw was a personal feud between Jafar and Ali clans involving the legancy of a incense lamp from a common ancestor. As for Jafar accounts we know that the lamp was especially design to be used with blue basil from India and other undentified spice, that mixed together produced vivid alucinations. We know that addiction to blue basil finally undermined the Alladins rule after the third generation (Aladdin was still alive at that time but abdicated in favor of his son Abu because of his alucinations and addiction to blue basil and supposedly discovery of a new world in his alucinations.) . To answer your questions. There was not a new kingdom or ruler in Agrabha, there was only a broke prince Ali who created a the myth of Alladin to appeal to popular masses but finally abdicate because of blue basil allucinogens.

First, many people don't want treatment or do not think they can manage to get clean. Many drugs have very bad physical withdrawal symptoms, and drugs can also be used as self-medicating tools for individuals with mental health issues so it's hard to cut cold turkey. This can be helped with safe injection sites, which not only helps users not overdose, but there are trained staff available for education purposes, and some of these locations may also have connections with rehab agencies. Instead of hiding the issue of addiction and pushing these people aside and further alienating them, I personally believe that having these agencies around is important and may persuade people to seek help or use these resources.

Housing is also a really large issue: homeless shelters and soup kitchens are great band-aids, but these people may never have access to the resources to get appropriate long term/permanent housing. Financial reasons are obviously huge, but some individuals may not be able to sustain their housing on their own because of the reasons you mentioned above (like mental health or addiction issues, which also prevent these people from becoming employed)

Some people think that having more affordable housing locations is the solution, but these individuals also need actual support. So getting people into homes but also to have staff act as case managers to ensure that their needs are being met. Cooperative land owners are a must, and an understanding community is essential. 
There are also supportive housing locations which may house more than 1 person, where the location has daily staff to help clients manage medications and daily living.

True, but some estimate up to 12% of America's homeless population are veterans.

http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics/

That's not booze, drugs, or any other addiction.  That's the US failing to support their troops after they're done serving.  I'd bet most of the homeless vets have PTSD or something similar that prevents them from functioning in society.  The VA needs to step up the level of care for our veterans.

Thanks for sharing your story, it's very brave of you. In the first place I never spoke about banning talking about drugs completely I suggested allowing it in a designated place, but I was at the disadvantage of never using What's forums to see the threads in question or knowing how the forum is structured.

Regarding my drug views I think one problem is children were told nothing but how awful drugs are, yet when they try them they feel absolutely amazing, most drugs are extremely enjoyable at first to say the least and some like crack or meth will feel like the most amazing thing they've ever done. After feeling so incredible many people feel like they've been lied to and that's why children need to be educated with the whole story, both good and bad.

Heroin for instance makes you feel very nice at first and there's not really any obvious downside as you won't rattle on the 1st occasion either. Barely anyone just tries it once however and after just 4 days you could already be physically addicted, and a rattle isn't like the flu as the doctors might tell you, it's MUCH worse and is not only agony physically, it destroys you mentally too to the extent that you'll feel like you can't cope with living for another 5 seconds, yet you'll have around 4 days before you even start feeling better. Once hooked on heroin your entire life will revolve around getting your next fix and you will be willing to sell or do virtually anything to get it. Many people who wouldn't have dreamed they were capable will resort to crime once addicted to heroin and once you are properly hooked you won't even be taking it to feel good any more, your body will simply need it just to feel "normal".

Another example is crack, take it just once and it's so nice that you'll think of nothing else but getting more of it, you'll spend all your money and sell everything to get it, nothing else will matter apart from taking it and long term commitments like going to work will seem much less important as long as you get your next hit now you'll skip work and worry about it later. After being hooked for a short while you will enjoy taking it less however and you'll be taking even more so you don't feel terrible when you're not taking it, also you'll experience more side effects that are sometimes reduced by taking other drugs like heroin for instance which will obviously make things much worse overall and you will very quickly go downhill to the gutter in every respect. If you say have rent money to avoid being thrown onto the street in your hand and no spare money you will spend it on crack and worry about being thrown on the street later, that is why so many drug addicts are homeless, it's less often the other way around where they take drugs after ending up on the street.

Regarding speed, people may think it's not that bad compared to herion, crack or meth, but I bet you really enjoyed it at first, it would make you feel alert and capable of doing almost anything with a lovely warm feeling at the same time. To cut a long story short, after a while you'd be taking more and more of it trying to feel the same, until eventually you find you're taking it just to get through a normal day and not to feel amazing any more, then when you don't take it you'd feel unbelievably fatigued and then the horrible depression sets in. Your sleep pattern would have been all over the place where you'd sleep for long periods, while staying awake at other times and it would become increasingly difficult to perform normal everyday tasks.

Another way of looking at narcotics is like going to a loan shark, except you borrow good feelings instead of money, later however you have to pay it back with lots of interest which can often be over a long period of time.

Edit: spelling / grammar mistake - changed a "you're" to a "your".

My point was that not all homelessness is due to mental illness and/or addiction. That's oversimplifying the problem.

We can probably break the problem into categories which might help us get a better handle on it:

* those who are homeless due to addiction and/or mental illess
* those who are homeless due to economic problems

Many in the first category actually don't care that they're homeless (in fact many of them seem to prefer to live outside).

The vast majority of those in the second category would prefer to be living in a home of some sort.  I agree that it should be less complicated to help those in the second category, but ultimately we need to fix our economic system to do this well.  Things like universal health care, paid sick leave and paid leave to care for sick children - the fixes may not be all that complicated, but our political system keeps these things from happening (so ultimately maybe it's our political system which needs a complete overhaul).

Hijacking your comment!

Finding food and water ain't even hard. Finding food with any amount of nutrition is a little more challenging. Starches are everywhere! The odds you starve to death as a homeless person in America, at least over on the west coast (I don't know the conditions in the rest of the country), is pretty tough to do.

Finding shelter can be a little more challenging. Some shelters have lines starting in the early AM just to get a bed. You'd think just finding a spot to camp would be easy, but you have to pay to camp nearly anywhere or it's illegal to camp.

From my personal perspective, health care and job services for homeless is really where America fails in terms of our homeless population.

*Other thoughts*: Added difficulty to being homeless brought on by those who became homeless due to drug/alcohol addictions, or sheer laziness. There are plenty of homeless who just got dealt a bad hand.

Fix our homeless situation. Offer work programs that provide housing in return for labor to improve the city. Create a drug rehabilitation program that pays the addict for staying sober. Offer mental health services to anyone who needs/wants with a partnership with the UO so psych students can gain experience under the direction of a licensed professional. Medications are free for these patients but we test their urine to make sure they're taking them and not selling. And probably more but that's where I'd start.

Well, I lived in Seattle, so I can really only talk about that. And FI people are unlikely to end up retiring in a major city, so I don't know how useful this will be.

Honestly, I don't think it's any worse than any other major city. It's true that some places in Seattle get a bit sketchy after dark, but it's mostly just harmless homeless people that came up there because the weather is more temperate. 

The most interaction I ever had with a pretty clear addict was a guy who came up to me and my friends while we were standing outside a concert. He told us that if anyone gave us shit in this city we just had to say that we were friends with "Streets". He assured us they would know his name. It was more funny than anything else. I've also seen a few drug deals go down while walking home from work, but I've seen drug deals in cities all over the world. Maybe I'm just jaded, I don't know.

I recently moved to the Boston area and I actually find homeless people and drug addicts to be much more overt here than in Seattle. There may or may not be fewer of them, but I actually had to push a guy off of me a few weeks ago, which is something I never had to do in almost 20 years of living in Seattle.

And if you're still worried, just remember that Seattle is one of the only cities with its very own [superhero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Jones).

Come on dude, did you expect the town to be 100% devoid of poor people and drug addicts? This is not the freaking Federation from Star Trek, every place has its share of poor and disenfranchised, and even in Berkeley you'll find a few diehard religious conservatives sneaking Chick-fil-a past the vegan restaurant that puts quinoa in everything. There will be a few homophobes anywhere you go.

In BBurg, these folks represent a much smaller minority than one would expect in a rural town in a Mid-Atlantic state. This is to be expected since the university brings in tons of educated people and tons of money for the community. Blacksburg definitely feels more similar to a NOVA suburb than it does to Pulaski, but it is not Northampton, Massachusetts.

&gt; Thanks for the answers! I think I got my answer after reading all the responses: The system above would provide help only to a minority of people; the majority is better off with BI so economically speaking BI is a better solution. If people need help they should seek it out, we shouldn't base our society on the needs of some minority.

No. 

With handouts, the goverments pays an organisation to get you off of your addiction. You fail, because they want to keep their jobs. Then after enough failures, they call the project a failure and you end up jobless and homeless on the street . 

With Basic Income you pay someone to get off your addiction. If that fails, you keep paying someone else until you find someone who can.

It's almost impossible to determine what would happen if every homeless addict was given a living wage for absolutely no work. A lot would use the money to get themselves a nice warm home to take drugs in, others would still manage to find themselves homeless, or even dead, in a couple of months.

There is also the reverse issue of people who work at the moment but would be addicts if they didn't have to. Plenty of people would happily spend there time on drugs if they didn't have to worry about money at all. There are people who have addictions and continue to work (and control the addiction to some degree) not only to feed the habit but to stop themselves from ending up homeless. It kinda just isn't an option for some people. I know I couldn't last a week living on the streets.

Personally, given the ability to never work again and to not have to worry about paying rent or for food I could easily see myself developing a fairly nasty drug/alcohol habit.

I'm purchasing some cheap, vacant land in town and leasing it out to a nonprofit to build an urban farm. 

Purchase price is about $68k for .9 acre. Does anyone have thoughts on what's a fair rent for the land? 

Since the nonprofit will do all the hard work improving the land (it's currently overgrown, and homeless/addicts bunk up at night and trash the place), thus giving me appreciation, I don't think I need to hammer them with a ridiculous rent. 

I just want to earn about 1/2 to 3/4 my investment in 3-5 years.
