&gt;Just because YOU don't find them attractive doesn't mean they aren't.

If they weren't serving the purpose to redefine "attractive", they wouldn't call themselves plus sized models. They'd be models. Actual Body positivity doesn't exist simply because somebody is shouting and screaming about how positive they are. In all likelyhood, it's generally the inverse that's true. Rich people don't go around telling people how rich they are. 

I'm bored with this though. Your delusion is far beyond the reach of arguing even simpler points such as simply human biology, or the social dynamics of the hive mind purpose of haes, or why fit women are attractive to men not because of society, but rather because we're hardwired to seek out a mate that is healthy, and has qualities to offer that benefit the survival of the family unit. Seeing an obese person tells you a lot more about them than simply their weight.  Tacking the "judgemental" label on that is a practice in obtuseness.

You're quite stuck on the fluff of womens rights and the feelgoods of people not being mean, which isnt actually that you're wrong, it's just that its irrelevant and naive.  I wish you lucky with that mentality. To be sure, for the most part, I'm sure people like that are usually happier day to day, but people like that don't accomplish much of anything, nor do they actually keep the lights on for the rest of civilization.

Yeah.  You're right.  Fuck Jewish people too.  They could choose a different lifestyle as well.  And people who smoke.  And anyone without biceps or muscle definition.   They could work out more too.  And black people.   They could bleach their skin and stay out of the sun.  Why are they choosing to be so dark?  


Anyway.  Apparently you think fat people are literally nazis according to your own analogy.  When did they try to commit genocide?   I missed that in my history classes.  


There's no justifying hatred.  You can enjoy making fun of people over something as superficial as their weight, but you can't pretend it's because it helps them or they deserve it.  No one deserves that shit.

&gt;That's easily said. But even if you were honest about it, this doesn't apply to anyone, and once a sufficient number of people living under comparable circumstances became aware what funny stuff you can do with a few torches and pitchforks, this has led to the toppling of some societies. 

It's easily said because it's a viable way to think. Do you evenly split all your wages with the local homeless, or do you value what you earn and feel that you have a right to do as you wish with it? Do you sleep with 50 year old overweight women because nobody else wants to, or do you sleep with who you like? This question is always about forcing women to do the *right thing* when it comes to sex, getting them to be *fair* with their vaginas. It's a ridiculous concept.

&gt;Tbh I thought that the point was pretty silly to begin with, which was the reason why I didn't bother to argue that point

But it's cool for people to say that sexual choice should be taken away from women to make it easier on some guys? I think that's pretty fucking silly, myself.

Bro...the Army (well, most of of Fort Benning at least) is run by asshole civilians. Most of them are obese black women. Finance, ACAP, DFAC and now the VA...pick a place where civilians run the show and it's going to be a bunch of fat bitches. Period. I think the Dependas realized they need some type of employment so they can afford more moo-moos and bon-bons. They forgot about that faded piece of paper on the wall that starts with 'I AM AN ARMY CIVILIAN...'
This, amongst other reasons is why the Army is setting itself up for a big fall. We are far too dependent on contractors. I'm really sorry you had a shitty experience. I hope this made you realize that the machine is broken and full of nothing but good intentions and PR. This is why we take care of our own. Forget about those fucking people, I'll buy you hearing aid batteries and your cat a chew toy. Well done for not flipping out, it wouldn't have helped anyway.

I think a lot of it is merely the attributing of it to certain races. If you say a lot of these things without saying it was the Jews that did it(or blacks or whites or whatever other incredibly broad category) most people would agree that war is bad and the war profiteers are bad, or that profiting on the misery of others is bad, but then, (I guess?) people saw Jews in some of those power positions and assumed it was just all the Jews doing rather than just a fact of life that the people that go after power are the ones you don't want having it. Think about it this way - if 1000 Americans immigrants from Nigeria came to hold most of the banks and a catastrophe happened and a bunch of people got foreclosed on and businesses went under etc. you would have a large portion of the Nigerians in this country all of a sudden having a shitload of wealth while everyone else was losing their livelihoods. You would not be surprised to see emotional or uneducated people decrying the takeover of the country by the evil Nigerians because to a moron that is what it would look like.

The reason something like this would happen is because people largely stay with similar people. Germans with germans, irish with irish, etc. and so a lot of the knowledge(or fallacies) of a group is traded within their own group faster than to the rest of the surrounding people. A few people from a small group decide banking(or whatever) is a profitable business and they will tell their friends, get their cousins jobs in the industry, the kids will hear about grandpa or uncle _____ making money and it will spread through the small group. From the outside it could look like a takeover but its really just normal human interaction.

An example for that would be blacks in football/basketball. Its not that blacks are naturally gifted athletes(iirc black women are more likely in the US to be obese than whites) but simply a common way of seeing things that you hear from many athletes - a lot of kids in ghettos think that being a rich athlete is the only way out of poverty. They are wrong, but because this is something that a disproportionate number of their community thinks at a young age so it ends up making a lot more blacks be really good at football and basketball.

Basically a lot of what they said was true, but they applied it too liberally to this race or that rather than the specific people that did it. Even if 90% of the banks of the world were owned by Jews and run in an evil manner, it does not necessarily follow that Jews are 90%(or 100%) evil and money hungry. Most(all?) bankers were men as well, should Hitler and the Germans have taken the rights away from MEN in general? Obviously not.

&gt;The size 0 trend of the runway model industry is definitely disturbing, but it's getting less and less acceptance in the rest of the world. The trend is more towards 'real women' in advertising, which is a good thing.

It is, and I'm glad it's happening. I've heard people call this 'real women' trend a problem though because it's supposedly supporting "obesity acceptance," except the models aren't even overweight, they're just not skinny.

&gt; Just as people should not be influenced by the media into thinking that anorexic looking bodies are normal, they should also not be influenced into thinking that obese or even decently overweight bodies are normal. 

Agreed, I'm just saying I don't see this happening nearly as often as I hear people talking about it happening. Granted there is a wide variance in media and advertising between geography and audience, so I can't say I've seen everything. 

Any of the body-positive or real-women type messages I've seen haven't been "it's okay to be fat," but rather "you shouldn't hate yourself because you're fat," assuming they are actually fat to begin with (see above). Bullying overweight people into feeling worthless, which is what I see a lot more of than "obesity acceptance," isn't going to help anyone. 

My main point is there's a difference between saying "there's nothing wrong with being fat" and "you're not a bad person just because you're overweight." The latter doesn't condone unhealthy weight or weight gain, and can lead to a better sense of self respect and promote healthier goals. 

As far as photoshop, most of my concern lies with younger people. I wouldn't even say people should stop using it, as long as it's known how dramatically it can be used and how these magazine models' proportions are just as much a fantasy as the giant fluorescent butterflies behind them. Most adults don't care, but teenagers can get obsessive. 

Edit: Most of the photoshop work I see isn't even just narrowing waistlines, it's a lot of editing out any folds or creases or dents that are caused by clothing or positioning and have nothing to do with weight, but a lot of younger girls start thinking "if my bikini straps push a dent in my skin, there must be too much fat there because I don't see it on the model." Or when the area between the hips and the rib cage is elongated, so curves start higher and things like elbows don't line up where they should. A lot of people can look at it and think "something about this doesn't look right," but the more impressionable think that's the ideal and "something about me doesn't look right."

Reddit is a forum predominately full of white, (assuming) middle class Americans. They dont' understand or want to understand poverty or obesity (Look at how many Ask Reddit and other subreddit posts are about how disgusting fat people are or how poor people do it to themselves).

It's an American centered site full of whites...Not surprised that this happened.

Thanks for your response!  I'm sorry you're having so much difficulty with things :(

The last job...well it was a combination of work and my personal life.  But I felt like I was being bullied a bit at work.  It was a small open office...the job was VERY social, going around to various departments in the company, scheduling things.  I'm a very introverted person and my first job out of college was a lot more solitary in nature.  On a personal level, I am 26 and still a virgin, and at the time had never been on a date in my life.  I actually grew up obese and at the start of 2013 lost 45 pounds in 6 months after getting fed up with myself, and I've kept it off!  So it's something I'm proud of.  I finally faced my anxieties with dating and have been using OKCupid.  I have a much healthier mindset now.  So I tried to mix business with pleasure stupidly by asking out my coworker, huge mistake...she wasn't interested but worse than that, she did a total 180 on me.  We got along pretty great before that but after that she was mean and nasty and cold toward me.  So I contributed to my own personal hell.  Also my manager did not manage at all, it was a complete free for all for the work, no sense of organization.  I, like you, had a bad feeling when I walked in to the office for the interview and the office area had stacks of papers and folders piled 6 feet high (not exaggerating) and very sloppy / clustered all over.  So going forward, I'm going to take those red flags seriously.

So I have a list of things I think would be really hekpful:

- job is solitary in nature
- manager who really takes charge
- more interesting work.  R&amp;D would be better (was what my first job was similar to)
- Short commute (less than 25 minutes)
- No/ very little overtime

I think that about summarizes it.  Basically trying to correct the things I think are problems from my last job, combined with the positive things from my first job.  I don't expect to get every single bullet point in one job, but most would be needed I think.

Anyway lol.  Unfortunately I live in a high cost of living area (1 br apartment ~$1500/month), whereas the new job is located further in to the suburbs and a 1 br apartment is closer to $1000/month.  House share seems to be around 600-700 per month.  The reason I quote a 1 br is because of a cat.  I think it would be cool to get my own cat, but most house shares won't allow it.  And honestly, I really value my sleep so I don't think I could stand a cat waking me up in the morning (hence slashing out a studio from consideration)...well at least in dealing with our cat now, but he is a 6 month old rambuckious kitten.  Maybe if I got an older rescue cat, it would be more tame and laid back.

So it's a question of cost...this is what sucks about my area is that it's expensive.  I had thoughts of moving to Nashville (almost obsessively so after leaving my last job) because I have a couple friends who live there.  But most of my friends and family are here in New York.  Wish I lived in a cheaper cost of living area but eh.

Ah man yea...I haven't been following up on every job lead.  I got one call from jersey and another in my area, but I never followed up and returned their call.  I should really do that tomorrow.  Your story about multiple interviews and offers makes me think that I should try to schedule as many interviews as I can in this time period, so that I could perhaps get multiple job offers and not feel forced in to a specific one.

Well yea you were saying about moving jobs and where you live at the same time if tough, but I'm not sure how else people could do it lol!  I'm fortunate that I have a lot of savings and could afford to move somewhere without a job.

So I kinda have to bite the money bullet to have a cat and stay near my friends/family...but if it's the only way I can function on a daily basis...it might be the way I have to go...

I was very obsessed with being homeless, living for as little as possible, moving to cheap areas...all these sorts of things...obbssessed with those ideas when I left my last job.  Those thoughts are MUCH more reserved now, but I think the theme is something I'm interested in.

Yea I should see what my therapist thinks too...boy lots of stuff happening.  Thanks again for responding and I hope to hear from you again :)

Not if you're competing with frozen processed foods.  A 14 serving lasagna is less than $10 at walmart.  That's less than $1 per serving.  Almost nothing you can cook is less than that.  Even just using beans rice and potatoes.

Cheap crappy food is cheap and efficient.  That's why poor people are obese.

&gt;How can the cost possibly be different.

Really? Do I have to walk you through economics now too? 

&gt;They also have a superior level of care.

Dude, I'm an MD working in the US. They have shit care for the vast majority of people. But you don't have to take my word for it. Look at infant mortality. Look at life expectancy. Look at the outcomes for numerous illnesses. The US has shit healthcare. Even for the wealthy, outcomes are worse. As it turns out, epidemiology is a thing. When a large portion of your population is sickly, it spreads to the rest of the population. From an epidemiological standpoint, even things like obesity appear to be contagious. 

&gt;For example, their wait times are much shorter.

Total bullshit. The wait times for most things are very similar. People wait in the ER here for hours just like in Canada. I know because I work in a US hospital and have waited in the ER here for hours. People wait months for non-critical surgeries, just like in Canada. You are just spouting conservative propaganda and have no clue what you're talking about.

I don't either, but I do think there are some good ideas floating around. Body cameras are a no-brainer, IMO. We need them, the cops need them, everybody benefits from them. There *are* some thorny issues about privacy violations with them, but I think solutions to those issues can be found, and the benefits of increased accountability and evidence in such cases far outweigh the risks of privacy violations. 

Another idea I thought of a little while back was for states/cities/the federal government to air PSA commercials that educate people about what their rights are (and aren't) and how to interact with police in a safe manner. There should probably also be a module related to this in H.S. curriculums. We need to do more to ensure that the general public knows how to handle themselves when dealing with the police. 

Furthermore, while I feel like I don't know enough about policing to comment intelligently on it, I am a little confounded as to why police departments conduct their own investigations into allegations of police misconduct and abuse, as that seems like an obvious conflict of interest to me. There ought to be an independent investigation agency that does not have ties to the police in any way. Other PDs investigating each other is not acceptable in my view, because of the risk of police being biased in favor of their "brothers/sisters" from other departments.

Lastly, I think police officers ought to be trained better in hand-to-hand combat, particularly forms that focus on subduing/restraining, like jiujitsu. There is next to no reason for a cop to actually punch a perp. If the perp is attacking the cop with his/her bare fists, the cop ought to know how to pin the perp on the ground without striking. Also, they should be required to remain fit; obese cops are a liability to themselves, their fellow officers, and the people they serve (citizens). 

The problem of systemic racism/prejudice in the justice system overall is another can of worms entirely, and a much more difficult issue to solve, IMO. I live in NYC, and we recently went through this whole stop-and-frisk shit. Bloomberg intended it to help police make more petty drug arrests, but all it wound up doing was giving police license to harass the poor and the brown. On the other hand, a similar law instituted in Chicago was used to help cops get illegal guns off the street, and it has been very successful from what I've heard. 

Honestly, the problem is that our society as a whole is still quite prejudiced—the problem is neither isolated to nor more pronounced in law enforcement, it's just that the consequences of that prejudice are often much more severe for the victims. However, I also think that some of the people most frequently victimized by that prejudice (Blacks, Hispanics, the poor, etc) blow it out of proportion sometimes, and that's a kind of prejudice too. Assholes like Al Sharpton profit by stoking anger in the citizenry rather that pursuing actual solutions, and make the entire situation worse for both sides. Lastly, I think the root of this problem ultimately lies in the appalling way in which we have ignored the education disparities between upper-, middle-, and lower-class citizens. If we could provide impoverished neighborhoods with safe, quality schools for twenty years, we could raise a generation of children that grew up poor, but have the tools to become productive members of society as adults. Currently, shitty standards and lopsided allocation of funds have created a cyclical system that makes it very difficult for poor kids to remain in school, which leaves them few options apart from the street and a life of crime.

Yea BMI is not really that good to evaluate individual people, it's more for population purposes. For example, I used to weigh 150lb at 6' similar as the guy above, and after 7 months of weightlifting managed to become barely "overweight" in BMI terms while wearing the same size clothes and everything because muscle is denser than fat.

A good complementary way to figure out if you're really overweight/normal is taking waist, hip and neck measurements. There are some ranges in those measurements that can complement BMI.

From a healthcare perspective, food like pizza is minimal in its nutritional value. It is high in empty carbs, saturated fat, processed meats, and preservatives depending on the establishment you buy pizza from. A lifestyle of eating this kind of food is a contributing factor to common health issues such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, gout, or cancer. This is taken out on healthcare system. While I sympathize with hard working families on welfare programs, I do support subsidizing healthy lifestyle choices over unhealthy choices. Chicken breast over red or processed meats. Veggies and fruits over processed foods. It used to be that the rich were the unhealthiest and the poor were the healthiest in diet, now it is the opposite. One reason is that healthier foods can be more expensive which is why I support subsidizing foods that are healthier.

Hey, check out the fucker's post history. He makes a number of statements that are far more offensive than that:

"I'll speak from a personal standpoint. To me, a gorgeous woman is gorgeous no matter what race. **Regarding black women, the majority I see are fat and that's a major turn off for me.** Many others have odd proportions like very long legs and short torsos. Very wide noses and large foreheads (hairlines far back) are two traits that are common and I don't find appealing."

"Until more cops get killed just for being cops they have no reason to change."

Regarding innocent cops getting killed - "Cops are killing people every day with no justice being served. What the fuck did they think would happen?" 

"I love how these people will post pictures of how disgusting they've become and then say shit like "my body isn't your business". Spoiler alert, you make it public and it's fair game for concern or ridicule."


"Meh, most of them are too fat to have sex or even get pregnant. Hopefully the ones that do procreate have kids who think "no way in hell I want to end up like that".

"Seems like a high number of these angry HAES lunatics are lesbians. And it was just the other day people on Reddit were talking about how gay guys usually are fit and the women are fatties."

"How many fat people would move to India? Underabundance of cheap food, lack of space, lack of AC, lack of fatty scooters... And Indian people aren't into fatties either. Not sure where that delusion comes from."

"How does a fatty get a job as a PE teacher? That's madness."

"It was probably written by a middle class white girl in the suburbs who thinks she's Asian and is jealous she has no guys interested in her fat weaboo ass."

"So many fat people are similarly guilty. "I'm not a size 22, I'm a size 8 just like you! I want to try on a size 8!"

"Zee Germans love marching for a cause."

"It's like a circle of stupid fattery. If she receives so many emails, why not publish 

"Fat people and bikes don't mix, especially road bikes. She absolutely will need a custom seat otherwise the normal one will disappear in her ass, quite literally. There won't be enough width to actually hold her like a normal person."

"Hey, come live in our country to get away from the shit hole country you were in. Oh, and feel free to complain and be an asshole! They should get the boot."

In the past (pre-industrial/ early industrial society) the primary restriction placed on food from an economic standpoint was the amount of calories a person of means could buy more and richer food and thereby eat more calories (think Henry VIII). A poor person on the other hand would be restricted to an often largely bread based diet (and usually whole grains to boot since they used to be cheaper). An example of this is the Ancient/early medieval Roman bread dole. A poor Roman would receive an allowance of bread and olive oil (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_supply_to_the_city_of_Rome). 

Then, from the shadows, along comes the industrial revolution. Previously meat, one of the more calorie rich foods, was very expensive. With industrial production it becomes available to anyone (think McDonalds Dollar Menu). Even more insidiously, sugars (like corn syrup) have become so cheap as to be almost free. This means that a person can make an incredibly caloric, cheap, and addictive food. 

That's just one side of it though, while unhealthful foods became cheaper, healthful foods became relatively more expensive. The industrial revolution made all food cheaper, but unhealthful foods much much more so. In the ancient world most of an average person's income went to food (see Diocletian's Edict on Prices). This means that hamburgers are cheap and wholesome vegetables are more expensive. This is partly to do with demand (most people think hamburgers taste better than broccoli) but also due to the cheapness of sugar (see the book, Sweetness and Power). 

Another element is education. The poor are statistically less likely to be educated than the affluent. A person who is uneducated is less likely to know which foods are healthful and which are unhealthful. In a position where the relative healthfulness of foods is not explained, rational actors will seek the cheapest and best tasting foods. Wholesome foods are also less available in poor areas. Supermarkets are businesses with razor thin profit margins. They need to use a huge amount of space and the margins on food are very low. This makes it not economically advantageous to build these businesses in poor inner cities. This creates what are called "food deserts"; these are places with high populations but low access to supermarkets. If you are too poor to own a car you can't simply drive to the rich area to buy food. Often, McDonals/ 7-11 is the only food choice that the poor have (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert).

These factors (and a bunch of others that I could go more into) make the poor more likely to be obese.

&gt; I am not going to sit here spending actual time weeding through anything in FPH to educate you that your completely assinine view is actually completely assinine.

Ok, so you don't actually have evidence for the behavior you're assuming takes place.

&gt; The fact that you are basically saying " oh yeah?! Prove it!!" Is well past more than enough for me to see your true agenda lies not in a mutual and informative reciprocation and exchange of information, no.

What? Are you serious? Have you heard of the scientific method? You know how classic debate and scientific research takes place, right? If I walk up to you and tell you that the sky is green or that you are bad at your job, it's on me to demonstrate those statements are factual based on evidence. It's not your responsibility, is it?

*You* posit that FPH is about "generalized hate", which isn't even a meaningful term, but we'll sidestep that for now. The onus is on *you* to present evidence backing up your hypothesis/argument.

&gt; You dont like that people think your views on fat people are essentially that of a shitbag bully, that doesnt like sounding like a shitbag bully.

Bully is an overly politicized term that people use for children. If you want to call me "a big meanie head", I'm totally fine with that. The ad-hominem component just makes it seem like you don't have an argument.

&gt; No you want someone to hold your hand and tell you honey, your hate helps the world. Hate is good, you are good. What a good person.

I want no such thing. Again, you're assuming FPH is the entirety of every participants actions against the obesity epidemic.

&gt; Wow dude. Gfto. You cannot argue that FPH reddit and others like it are not generalized hate groups, just because I am not up for playing your shitbag troll game doesnt mean you arent defending a fucking hate group.

Is it a hate group? Or a generalized hate group? Which is it? What even is a generalized hate group? We don't allow anything with respect to children. We direct the hate on the mentally disabled on their caretakers. People address actual demonstrable medical conditions pretty quickly in the sub. Again, many work in medicine. It doesn't make sense to call something generalized when there are giant and rational exceptions, does it?

&gt; Did your parents teach you anything at all? I had terrible parents and have been abused and neglected, lived on the streets alone and homeless as a 12 yr old girl and I seem to know more than you do about what it means to be humane.

An appeal to emotion? Another classically bad, non-argument technique. It's generally immediately recognized and discarded in any scientific discussion or debate. I have a few drug and alcohol addicts in my family. I've seen plenty. I also have a brother who was obese and basically needed to be forced and monitored to bring him back from the brink of death. None of that is actually relevant, though, now is it?

Humane is getting others to live longer for their families and reducing their load on an overburdened planet. It is *not* **enabling** someone to continue eating to death. Is it humane to tell an alcoholic that 8 drinks a day is perfectly ok, *as long as he isn't hurting anyone else*? No. How about a compulsive speeder? A meth addict? 

The hate in the group really stems from the global enabling of a bunch of addicts, and how they flaunt their addiction and this enablement. Half of the sub is dedicated to people hiding that they're fat, lying about calories or exercise. In the presence of an actual unified, public and global response to obesity that isn't complicit in their self-destruction, there would be no FPH. It is the residual of a system that thinks "no tough love because we might hurt someone's feelings"  is going to have real and widespread results. Instead, you're seeing people have ads taken down for the body type offending them (like, wtf) and the message that overeating is not only ok, but *expected* being spread to our children.

Tough love works, especially with addicts. There are almost daily (instantly-banned) comments from people thanking the group for the tough love. I don't care if you want to refuse that as a possibility, it is happening.

&gt; How people like you get this way and stay this way is just absurd. No heart, full of your own entitlement, insecure and petty just waiting for someone to shove down a notch.

You realize that your armchair psychiatry technically counts as "bullying", right? Ad-hominems just make your argument seem ill-founded.

I guess the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/index.html) (which has a division whose largest mandate is obesity), the [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/) (consequences on society of obesity) and the [US Dept of Health and Human Services](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527647/) (insane growth of obesity) are bullies too, in saying that obesity does affect others than those who are obese.

If you want to *actually* discuss hate. Why are you so up in arms about people who don't like glorified addicts with self-inflicted medical issues? Where's your rage about subs dedicated to dead children photos, coontown or gas the kikes? We hate people because they chose to affect everyone negatively. These other subs are dedicated to hating people based on genuinely uncontrollable circumstances. Isn't it quite strange how much heat FPH takes, in the existence of those subs? What about just neckbeard things? Is that ok because it's tends to be more about obese men than women? Tumblr in action? The bullying is ok because it's not specifically about a self-controllable problem?

Sorry. I thought I edited the comment it must not have went through. I meant /r/coontown.

Also, can you explain to me why it's worse that /r/fatpeoplehate "appears to be targeting a single individual" versus the racist subreddits I linked to that I guess you feel target a group? 

Because I disagree. /r/fatpeoplehate hates fat people. Fat people are as much of a group of people as black people are.

Our starting stats are pretty similar: f/28/5'2" SW:235 

I had spent years thinking on and off about losing weight, about how next month I'd start but first I should really eat the rest of the bad stuff I've got laying around. I paid for it, may as well enjoy it before kicking the habit of junk food, right?

Well, I never did any of that. I never made any real attempt at becoming healthier. Until I heard about the connection between diabetes and Alzheimer's. 

I'm not married, I have no children, and I'm unlikely to have a job that properly allows me to prepare for retirement. Diabetes runs on my father's side of the family and my maternal grandfather got Alzheimer's. 

I don't want to be the person who gets put in a government nursing home, wasting away and only half aware of it. 

I don't want to have to think about how I'm posing in pictures to look "less fat."

I don't want to be the one that my friends and family have to wait for when we go hiking.

I don't want to be the one relying on pills to stay healthy for the rest of my life.

I don't want to get hit with depression and have my weight to beat myself up about.

But mostly, this time, I don't want my weight to be what disconnects me from people. I am not rich, I'm certainly at or below poverty level, but I know that compared to the rest of the world I'm quite wealthy. I have an AMAZING opportunity to teach overseas this summer, and am SO EXCITED to do it.

But send a fat girl to a poor country and expect them to connect? If weight is associated with wealth, what will they think of me? Will they believe anything I say to them about my struggles? 

It's not that I think any of those conversations will come up, but the truth is that people do judge us by our looks, and we need to be aware of and accept that. It's not always in a bad or mean way, but it happens. I don't want to lose opportunities to connect with people because I'm bored and decide to eat, or because I decided that I don't care to have enough will power to stop eating for the rest of the night.

And I don't want to convince myself that I'm obese because of my "health issues." I've got enough diseases (or syndromes, depending on the doctor) to say, "Oh, it's my thyroid's/hormone's/blood sugar's fault." Because guess what? Eating well is what makes those things go away.

Not all of them, of course, but since I started working on myself a lot of the problems I had before have been going away. But I don't get the shakes when I haven't eaten in a while, I don't feel my heart begin to pound wildly after a bad meal (which, seriously, why in the world did that not scare me enough to make me stop eating so badly before? I don't know what additives were in that food to cause that reaction, but SCARY), and I'm sleeping longer and deeper. And that's in the middle of finals stress!

This is getting really long, I'll try to wrap up:

I had a lot of little reasons to get in shape and to control my eating and one day I just decided, "You know? This is enough. I'm doing it for real this time." And I did. I got on the scale this morning to (finally!!) see 199.8. In ten more pounds it'll likely be the lowest weight I've been at in *at least* five years. And I'll just keep going because I'm doing it for me, because *I* deserve to be happy in my skin, and *I* deserve to be able to go out and do new things and *I owe it to myself* to make up for all those years of mistreating and hating myself. 

Depression sucks and it's totally draining, but it doesn't have to win. The thoughts it sends your way about how you can't stop or how you have no will power? Bull. It's your mind, your rules. You decide what's true and what isn't. The truth is that *you can do this.* You can change your life for the better and lose the weight; hey, you *quit smoking.* That's HUGE! 

You know you have the ability to change your life; you've done it before!

Food poverty is a real thing, whether you thinks so or not.

In socio-economically deprived areas, there can be a complete lack of affordable healthy food, and your only options are high calorie, high carb, low nutrient foods. 

If the only foods you have access to, either due to physical availability or budget, are high in sugar, high in calorie, nutritionally poor, you won't be eating foods that trigger your body's hunger mechanisms. You could eat three big MacDonald meals a day, consuming many times your daily calorie needs, yet still feel hungry as your blood sugars and insulin will be fucked.

There is a direct correlation between poverty and obesity in the US and UK. It's not that poor people are lazy and greedy, but that their food choices are limited and directly result in weight gain.

To tackle obesity, the same tactics use to address smoking need to be taken:

* Strong regulations and restrictions on the food industry, with labelling and taxation to drive up cost and promote the health risks of junk food.  
 
* Regulation and restrictions for the sale of junk food to reduce its availability. Requirement for the availability of whole foods - fruit, vegetables etc. 

* Strong promotion of the health issue of weight gain, so ensure that obesity is not socially acceptable and normalised.

* Access to free health and diet advise from non-commercial sources.

&gt; You my friend, are the problem.

You obviously don't get out much if you think pro-Europeans are the problem. You think it's wrong to do what's best for Europeans? The best thing to do for Europeans is to stop breeding them out of existence.
The majority of posters in all the immigration crisis thread are supporting pro-European views.

&gt;&gt;I'm going to guess that you're between 25 and 35.

You just described 90% of the internet. I am 28.

&gt;&gt;socially isolated

Nope, lots of friends.

&gt;&gt;white male

Of course, I'm European!

&gt;&gt;who pays for sex

Why would I pay for sex when I have a wife who I have sex with? And unlike you, at least my family looks like they are my family. You look like you were adopted.

&gt;&gt;You are also slightly obese

I am around 60 kg.

&gt;&gt;Your annual income is between 25 and 35 thousand dollars a year

I am a mechanical engineer, so no.

&gt;&gt;You harbor a deep hatred of your more successful white peers and an even deeper hate of (insert non - white race) people who are doing better than you.

I love my superiors, they are great. And they are white too. We don't have non-Europeans like you working at my company.

&gt;&gt;In order to feel better about your current circumstance you find reason to blame others for your failings and seek solace in ideations about the superiority of your race.

It's not about my race being superior (of course black people think it is superior, which is why they so desperately want to move to a white nation and to mate with white women). It's about my race simply having the right to it's homeland and our right to not be invaded. It's about having you people just leave us alone to live in peace without you wanting handouts, welfare, and to marginalize our entire continent. People like you want to strip away the identity of Europe nations. You are invading our land and breeding us out of existence. I hate people like you because you make the indigenous people of Europe disappear. Even if white people were an inferior race, I would still care deeply about our future well-being. I view black people in Europe as a multiplying virus, a cancer. Saying you are European is like saying a white guy is Bantu, it's illogical and all it does is strip away what makes the people of this world unique. The world is vastly diverse, and large, with a home for every ethnic group... yet you non-whites won't let up. You are at white people's heels, trying to push your way into our tiny countries because you think you have the right.

I don't care if the white race is inferior or superior, you don't have the right to come into our homeland and change what it means to be a European. Europe has the right to be European, meaning it has the right to be native. It has the right to be itself. Just like Japan has the right to be Japanese, Korea has the right to be Korean, Africa has the right to be African.

Thats what I thought too but he left me alone after that and usually PTs are a lot more pushy than that. He seemed almost worried that I was even there to be honest, let alone the amount of weight I was doing. I'm pretty overweight but I have good strength for my size (I'm working towards slimming down, its one of my goals) so he probably thought I couldn't bench that much due to my appearance?

It is well known that genetics hugely influence sports, for example

http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/genetics.htm

http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/why-kenyans-make-such-great-runners-a-story-of-genes-and-cultures/256015/

It is very difficult to talk about this without sounding racist, but see the last link for some discussion of that as well.

It's important though to realize that it is **not** true that "Black men are at a physical advantage to other races", as you put it. That's simplistic. The reality is that African people have the largest genetic variation,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_variation#History_and_geographic_distribution

due to Humanity originating in Africa 100,000 or so years ago. As a result, there are more people at all extremes - tall people, short people, thin people, fat people, etc. in Africa. It's not that African people are "better", it's just that they are more varied, and happen to have plenty of people that are good at basketball, long-distance running, and so forth.

The average African American is not at an advantage. But over populations, the best basketball players tend to be African American, because there are more people there of the optimal shape. There are also lots of black people that suck at basketball, but they don't matter for that.

People can eat what they like, but they better manage their exercise and health. If they complain about bad health even though they haven't done jack to make sure that whole pizza doesn't kill them; it's their problem.

And on the second: Men and Women have preferences. Some like chubby, some do not. Get over it.

And off topic-ish: Have you seen an image of an obese person vs an average person? The fat in an obese person accumulates **all around the internal organs**

Honestly a virgin man wanting a virgin woman is neither shallow nor superficial nor unreasonable. Unrealistic perhaps ill grant you that but the world is a large place my young friend.

What qualifies me as a socially awkward weirdo or troll was perfectly acceptable when I lived in southeast asia. Whereas most of the western women i knew in Japan and later in China were overweight and feminist and deeply resentful and bitter.

One persons misogyny is another man or even an entire cultures norm or modus operandi. Why think just 50 short years ago most men were just as "chauvinistic" as me.

To extend the shoe analogy, imagine the shoe on the other foot. While some may not sell well in America they may sell well in Africa or Asia due to something as trivial as American brand recognition or perceived value of cool. Of course being devilishly handsome, well packaged and wealthy by association makes selling said shoe considerably easier... but i digress, the American market is yesterday. And its women,decidedly a poor investment. And a depreciating asset

&gt; Black women aren't more at risk because of "racial discrimination". They're more at risk because they're far more likely to be obese. 

Actually, probably they're more at risk because they're more likely to be uninsured, and therefore lack access to proper medical care during (and before) pregnancy.

The human race isn't dictated by evolutionary pressures anymore. There is no metric of fitness. Wealth? There are plenty of poor people having children. Charisma? Plenty of assholes have kids. 

The fact of the matter is that communities insulated from environmental forces through laws, technology, and resource distribution aren't in a system of 'survival of the fittest.'

Fat people won't become extinct. One, obesity is more conditioned than hereditary, and two, even assuming anything you said is correct, fat people still fuck.

I sort of agree, and sort of don't. I don't think we should accept overweightness and obesity as lifestyles that are just as good as being a healthy weight, or as inevitabilities. However, we should totally accept overweight and obese people as just as good as trim people, because the value of a person is inside, not in appearance or health status. Fat people are valuable people -- so let's keep them around longer!

That said, I don't think it's appropriate or helpful to criticize overweight people. Perhaps a close friend can express concern for health issues. And doctors absolutely should speak up about this, just as they would speak up about high blood pressure or high cholesterol or people who were underweight. (And while we're obsessing over thigh gaps, let's remember that too thin will kill you faster than too fat will!)

Lots of people on this thread, and the comment that is the original post, have pointed out that there are a lot of barriers to being a healthy weight. If we want to be supportive of people being healthy weight, maybe we can try to solve some of the problems that prevent healthy eating. Low wages lead to little money for healthier foods, and often to having to hold down more than one job, leaving little time for food prep and planning. Taking a thoughtful approach to eating is crucial in eating in a healthy way. Even farm subsidies -- they mostly go to grains, so that the cheapest foods are the empty carbs that make us fat! Maybe we should support an elimination of farm subsidies, or at least a shift to subsidizing tomatoes and lettuce instead of grains. Wouldn't it be great if poor people were more healthy than everyone else because their budgets meant they had to eat a lot of fresh produce! Also, if we support universal health care, then more people will have access to programs that can help them achieve a healthy weight. Locally, we can support funding for parks and community centers and sidewalks and bike lanes. All of those things encourage fitness.

It's really better for society to encourage and facilitate rather than to criticize. Overweightness and obesity is a health problem, leave any negative comments about it to the health professionals whose concern it is.

It's not as though there are no unattractive thin girls.  Why is he not getting messages from them?  It could be that the messages from fat and/or black women are just sticking out in his mind.  Or maybe he lives in the South, somewhere where there are a lot of black and/or fat white women.  Or maybe while he is not black, he may be of an ethnicity or a mix that might attract black women.  It could also be that while he thinks he is not overweight, he kind of is.  I too am merely speculating, but with a little more wiggle room.
