Because a fair share of the homeless don't want assistance. They're mentally ill or addicts to their chosen vice. 

Yes, there are some people that are  not homeless by choice, and those people need to be helped getting back on their feet.

&gt; Couldn't get a job at KFC? My BS detector is going off severely.

Maybe you got the job at KFC that he got rejected for.  Ever think of that?  What gives you the right to question his integrity anyway?  Whether he's bullshitting or not, you're the one that looks like the arsehole.

&gt; When I got accepted into the Army they begged me to stay....why?

My BS detector is going off.  You didn't get into the Army.. You were just one of the stoners ripping off chicken.

&gt; It's been a constant thoughout my professional life that dedicated people who work their arses off rather than put in the bare minimum effort for the bare minimum hours get ahead and are valued.

I've experienced the opposite.  It's been a constant in my professional life that the dedicated people that work their arses off get stuck doing the same job because they are reliable while the sycophants and the oxygen thieves that can't do their job get promoted out of harms way.

&gt; You are there to contribute to the business making a profit. If you aren't one of the performers, you risk getting the arse.

Tell that to the hard working men and women working in the manufacturing industries getting made redundant.  People that do work their arses off each and every day for fuck all pay in an industry that the government stopped caring about.

Tell it to the seventeen hundred nurses that Campbell Newman sacked when he became Premier of Queensland in 2012, then had the gall to say he was creating two-hundred "New" jobs for nurses in the 2015 election.

Tell it to the thousands of Middle-eastern, Afghani, Sudanese and Nigerian refugees that are unable to get jobs because some fuck head politician decided to whip the public into a mass panic of xenophobia on terrorism.

Sure there are under performers out there, but what do you know about them and their lives?  Do you know how many ex-diggers there are out there homeless or borderline suicidal because the ADF dropped them like hot pies when they started showing signs of depression and mental illness?  Can't get a job because the only life they knew was the ADF, and they couldn't adapt or connect with the real world.

Hi, stalker. I'm flattered that you were mad enough to come reply to my comments from last week.

I don't care what you think of transgender women. Do you also think that homosexuality is a mental illness or the work of the devil? Do you think that black people are naturally subservient to whites? Do you think that women aren't smart enough to vote or have real jobs? Because I don't give a shit about any of that either. You are on the wrong side of history. You will grow old and die and your shitty outdated opinions will die with you. The world will be a nicer, happier place for it.

I grew up helping out at a rescue mission for the homeless in a fairly large city.  You're right, sometimes it's awful.  I've heard some homeless people say and do pretty nasty things, but in the end they are still human and I still want to help them.  I couldn't care less if they are addicted to drugs or alcohol, if they need help, I'll do my best.  

It's easy to say, "Oh, well they're all ungrateful druggies" and wash you hands clean of them.  What I saw was not just addicts but mentally ill people with no option other than the streets.  I saw old people on fixed income who couldn't afford rent and had no family left to help them.  I saw families who came here expecting a better life and didn't realize the reality that was waiting for them.  If I have to put up with the drunks and addicts to help those who need it I will because it's worth it.

Unfortunately, most of the homeless suffer from debilitating mental illness, drug/alcohol addiction, or are vets with ptsd or other mental and physical disabilities.

give em each a quarter. give em a dollar. pick one person or pick ten. only do it on wednesday's. make your own ritual for how you feel about it. Perhaps I was over-zealous in my thoughts on this issue, but having a mental illness, and having been homeless, I know what it's like on the other side of the fence, and i would argue that the "overall majority" of Americans see homeless people as scum not worth a shred of human kindness.

  And poor people across the globe just happen to be the most morally deviant? Of course wealth inequality and poverty breeds resentment, it creates inequality of opportunity which turns disadvantaged people off pursuing legitimate career paths that they view as weighted heavily against them. And as you said 'of sound mind,' relative poverty is correlated with increased incidence of mental illness.

The huge proportion of income tax generated by the wealthy is just a reflection of the scale of inequality. The top 1% provide 24.1% of income tax but they have equivalent wealth to the bottom 60% of people. 

   It is absurd to make a moral argument for the correct particular percentage to take based on how a number feels. The best proportion is the one that makes the nicest society for the people that live in it. Right now it seems the proportion is causing wealth to pool and producing an increasingly unfair society.

I don't like this article ( mostly because it claims a causation that is too simplistic -- and excludes other major factors like shutting down many asylums under the Regan administration and forcing many mentally ill people into homelessness) , but: "Today blacks are about 13 percent of the population and continue to be responsible for an inordinate amount of crime. Between 1976 and 2005 blacks com­mitted more than half of all murders in the United States."

Based on the number of homeless still around, something about these shelters isn't adequate. Or maybe some of them suffer from mental illness and are thrown out because they cause problems.

&gt; I'm extremely pro gun. Like to the point that some might call me a "gun nut." I sometimes open carry (legal in my state), I have a concealed handgun permit (but believe that constitutional carry would be ideal), I reject the idea of background checks at gun shows, I've bought and sold guns in private sales. 

This seems to be your big sticking point.  Gun control.  Does this one issue really outweigh all the other issues?  Additionally, how much have you looked into gun control proposals?  I've found a lot of gun people have no idea how gun laws work in other states that have tighter restrictions.  Honestly, a lot of restrictions are made out to be far more burdensome then they really are if you are hearing about them from the pro-gun side.  Also, not every democrat is in favor of gun control.   

I'd suggest you do what you did with all of the other issues you've changed your mind on: look into what actual gun control organizations have to say about what they want.  The opposition doesn't always accurately represent what the other side wants to do.  

I'll tell you, personally I have a fairly nuanced position on gun control.  I have worked with mentally ill people and I can honestly tell you, not everyone who wants a gun should have one.  At the same time, I would never be in favor of a blanket ban on even just semi-automatics.  My state has some regulations I think are fantastic, and others I think are absolutely fucking ridiculous.

As for abortion, there are kids going to bed hungry every night in this country.  Kids who won't have a chance to get a decent education.  Kids who are homeless and living in tents or out of cars with their family.  Where I come from we take care of what we have before we go looking for more.  Once all of those kids are clothed, fed, educated, and housed I will listen to any argument on abortion someone wants to make.  Until then, I will not be party to forcing someone to bring a life into this world they can't provide for.

&gt; Most homeless people are homeless due to mental issues and/or drug addiction.

No doubt. I think 'most vulnerable members' includes those with mental illness, for whom society poses a greater threat to than they do to us, and with addiction.

I'm not saying I've opened my house up to homeless people, just how inherently politicised our views are toward them - perpetuated throughout news, movies and other media.

We're quick to discount how many are with disabilities, are LGBTQ+, victims of abuse etc., and engage in kneejerk dehumanisation due to a worst case scenario, overrepresented minority.

If there were more initiatives to portray homeless people as complex and self-actualised, and spreading the idea of housing as a basic human right, I think we'd see greater voting for socialised housing and fewer forms of subtle discrimination (i.e. paternalistically buying someone groceries when you don't know when they last ate, whether they're saving up for a hotel room etc.).

My remark came off as personal, but it was meant as a broader reflection scrolling down the thread.
<TRUE>
------
&gt;But compulsory treatment and institutionalization are the only real option for the severely mentally ill and chronically homeless. Their illness will often have led them to fear and reject voluntary treatment or government support, and until it is treated they will remain homeless.

This is a very scary proposition. Some people are mentally ill and can still reason and function. It's different if they're delusional and have lost touch with reality. But if you asked someone if this is a conscious choice and they explained their position in a well reasoned manner, they have to have that freedom. We can offer but we can't force.

Oh, I'm sure she is pretty religious, but in the end that is just a tool her brain uses to help make the justification easier.

How about any field that requires tremendous empathy and insight. I'd say all of the humanities and social sciences. So,  things like social work and psychology. And before you brush me off as "social sciences don't matter/aren't as elite as STEM",  I think things like figuring out how to feed the hungry,  house the homeless,  take care of abused children,  and treat mental illness are pretty important. 

Further,  there's nursing. Contrary to what you may think,  that is not "Less than a Dr". The type of people who go to medical school (male or female) and become doctors literally couldn't do a nurse's job. It's not who they are. It takes an entirely different skill set. One woman excel at more than men. 

All of this is assuming women can't do the exact same job as men exactly as well (spoiler alert: they can) I'm going with that assumption because there's no way to talk you out of it. Only time and experience will do that. You asked for real world examples,  so I have given you some.

Thank you for your kindness in a sea of ignorance.  And thank you for sharing that information about the situation in the Philippines, it's quite fascinating to me, and of deep personal interest.

I lost a wife to paranoid schizophrenia when I was in my early 20's, she killed herself while under "protective" watch in the psychiatric ward of the local hospital.  Her episode had lasted for months at that point, and it had devastated her, utterly devastated.  No matter how badly it hurt me to lose her, I almost think it was a kindness, because that illness is so truly terrible to the people that suffer it.  She would have spent the rest of her life at risk of slipping into an episode, and/or taking drugs that would feel bad.  Considering how incompetent the local hospital was, I felt like I would have needed to have my own padded room to keep her in when she had another episode, which is something I'm not really able to afford, nor am I well qualified.

I suspect in your area, death is the cure for many of the worst cases, and it's something that just isn't talked about much.  I am guessing we have to imply that they get killed, because many people surely can't and don't afford to keep their sick child caged or tied to a tree, but you know the general incidence rate has to be similar to "more developed" parts of the world.  Either that, or the inheritance rates are much lower there, because of much lower survival rate, effectively a kind of eugenic solution against mental illness.

Mental illness is a hard problem.  For the most part, I get the feeling that we only pretend to do better here in the "first world".  In my own life, here in Canada, I watched our government realize they couldn't keep running the old-fashioned mental hospital where they used to lock people away, and they were not willing to spend the money to build something that was modern and humane (I don't know if they even knew how).  So they kicked them all out onto the street.  I am not joking.  If you want to see the crazy people, they are the homeless in Vancouver BC.  They don't live very long, and it isn't pretty.  Sure, we treat some of them, but not enough.  They get rejected and demonized, jailed and abandoned.

I am guessing they probably get properly and fully taken care of in Northern Europe, and nowhere else.  And everywhere else in the world the governments are too corrupt, and the rich people too greedy, to allow enough equality of wealth for societies to really do things ethically, assuming they even know how.  We have to wonder if Islam is as miraculously "free" of mentally ill people as it is "free" of gay people. (angry sarcasm).

One thing I am sure of, is that people have a tendency to get into a frame of mind where they judge and blame and punish, and it is no good for compassion, and it is no good for fixing most of the problems they think they are fixing.  All they do is add more suffering to the world, it is a vicious cycle of viciousness.  And if anything, it is destructive for dealing with mental illness, a real tragedy in a place where the tragedy already runs so deep.

Cheers, and thanks again for reaching out.

Within the liberal community (because I'm less interested in how to make feminism more appealing to conservatives):

Feminism can't be so white, so upper-middle class, so strongly-associated with college students. It's not much numbers as representation that's the problem; the feminists that get the most air-time and screen-time to speak are white, conventionally attractive, and traditionally educated. Twitter and the internet is helping solve this problem somewhat but exacerbates this sometimes as well.

Related to this as well, we can't be so ignorant of how racism may factor into our solutions for sexism, i.e. carceral feminism. If we want to modify the justice system to be more harsh towards harrassment, cat-calling, rapists, etc., we have to always keep in mind that we're working within a hugely racist institution. It doesn't look good when you have white, upper-middle class feminists calling for less due process for sex crimes, and then not understanding why PoC or poor people might not be on board with making it easier for  the justice system to target them disproportionately

Related to this; issues that middle-class white women (and men) are interested in often get an amount of attention disproportionate to their severity. The internet blows up when Game of Thrones has an unnecessary rape scene or a comic book character is oversexualized (hobbies that are demographically more white/middle class), but there's much less emotion and fewer thinkpieces and tweets about the unprecedented rollback and closing downs of abortion clinics; because that primarily affects women who can't necessarily drive 80 miles away to the nearest abortion clinic for appointments and an abortion, i.e. poor and working class women.

One final note is that we can't be so casually discriminatory towards people with mental illness; stop calling anti-feminists "autistic", stop using "retarded" as an insult, and so on. The way we treat mental health is going to be the next big issue in social justice, and from what I've seen the average feminist is behind-the-curve right now.

It's sad to make this comparison, but we're almost facing the same problem that the Republican Party is facing; the world's demographics are moving away from whiteness and Euro-centeredness, but feminism isn't. Or at least, not as fast as it should be.

There is a lot of schizophrenia in my family and I agree with this. My uncle,  for example,  had the best care money could buy and he still experienced many disruptive symptoms of the disease and regularly expressed the wish to run away. His disease made him averse to stimuli and unfortunately even the best care means you must live in a facility with others which can easily feel toxic to a schizophrenic.  

This is anecdotal but nevertheless I think it's important to point out the article's faulty premise. 

My family's mental illness has given me much more compassion for the homeless than your average Portlander, but with that compassion comes the insight that it's very much not easily fixed.

2)  BART escalators allow unseen access by the homeless or other indigents to basically drink and poop and pee without being harassed by somebody that would see you above grade, given that after years of dysfunction they still don't have above-grade canopies and gates.  I'm not sure it's as much mental illness as it is a "necessity" for the people that are in those circumstances.  
<TRUE>

Yup. But also everything else too. More mental illness, more poverty, alcohol and drug abuse, etc, etc.

Again, on the flip side, you have more wealthy and better healthcare options (as with the NHS you rarely get options, but is free).

With regards to the 7% difference, again, whilst it seems pretty insubstantial, it does represent a difference of  millions.

It's one of the reasons I don't like statisticians! It's pretty easy to manipulate how good/bad people perceive something. For example, local papers scaremonger by saying something like "knife crime doubled in 6 months" without releasing the absolute numbers. Upon digging you find out there was only 2 incidents, which has doubled to 4... However, most people assume the worst!

I have worked with the homeless and mentally ill for the last decade, I have done so in multiple states and currently do it just outside Chicago at Elgin Mental Health Center

They have all kinds of options and I have seen many many many many many times they simply refuse the help or refuse to put in any effort to get the help.  If they have to do something they don't like or they don't like a certain medication they simply refuse all help.


Mind you the vast majority take the help, work the system and get on with their lives.  But those that just end up on the street, they are the one refusing the help, not wanting to do any of the leg work to get the help.

ANd their meds are paid for by the state if they do not have income of their own, in fact the state will get them disability checks for their mental illness and set them up with housing.

As for your comment "jail is how we treat mental health" that is bullshit media clickbait crap.

Now there are cases where the police will put charges on the mentally ill who refuse help so that they can get help forced on them.  However this is police thinking they are doing a good thing.  It is actually frowned upon despite the fact these cops are getting them off the street and into a mental health facility.

What the fuck is it with this self-entitled bullshit? There are genuinely mentally ill people out there, who are homeless and jobless because of their problems. Yet, this selfish ass is thinking about shit like that. Because fuck people who have real problems.

I know depression is easily dismissed, and I had people tell me that I shouldn't be depressed because there are people who have it a lot worse. That is not what I'm saying here.

I don't feel like it's a goofy plan, I feel like it's an ignorant and offensive one. I agree that we all have to be able to laugh sometimes, but I feel like it's disingenuous to clothe ignorance in a comedic cloak. 

&gt;Ultimately, though, the point I'm trying to make is that there is already a law that qualifies nearly every human in the US for a "basic income", because every single human is mentally weird in some way (relative to others).

You haven't made your point. It's simply not true. You're spreading misinformation about the DSM, mental illness, and disability. It feels like you really don't understand what people who are disabled by mental illness are going through. You can't in good faith compare stress to schizophrenia, for example. You can't in good faith compare being a little eccentric, to suffering from bipolar disorder. You can't in good faith compare going on a weird diet to suffering from anorexia. 

You can correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to be suggesting that mental illness is somehow equivalent to what the average person is going through every day. Or that all people are mentally ill because they're a little weird. 

You're not mentally ill because you're a little eccentric. You're mentally ill when you're suffering from a condition that impairs your ability to function. 

I don't deny that life sucks for a lot of people. You can be normal, stressed, depressed, and suffer from anxiety, but that's not the same thing as actually suffering from an incurable mental illness, or disability. 

&gt;You may not care, but I never even got disability

I do care. I care that people who should be getting a helping hand are being shit on by a system that denies them assistance by design. I personally believe that everybody should be on a basic income. I believe that means tested disability and welfare programs should be shut down.

I don't know whether you are disabled, or not. I don't know whether you can support yourself, or not. I can't weigh in on that, nor would I want to.

It's none of my business.

That's the beauty of basic income. You have freedom, dignity, and a level of privacy that doesn't currently exist on government welfare programs. 

&gt;you're exceptionally lucky to actually have been getting anything from the government at all

Yes, that doesn't mean they can't improve. I personally believe that all means tested welfare programs should be eliminated. 

I'm in favour of basic income.

*Culture &amp; History II*

**What are the most popular games? How important are they?**

In the past, the Kig-Yar would partake in gladiatorial battles to resolve disputes between clans, changing borders and establishing who would receive particular benefits. It is not believed this events continue in the 26th century. 

**Is there any discrimination against minority groups in this society?**

It is unknown how the Kig-Yar treat other ethnicities of their own kind, though they often look down at other races of alien, particularly the [Unggoy](http://www.halopedia.org/Unggoy), though traders like [Sav Fel](http://www.halopedia.org/Sav_Fel) are known to look down on even the [Sangheili](http://www.halopedia.org/Sangheili). Male Kig-Yar are treated as marginalized minorities by females, and poor Kig-Yar do not live amongst wealthy ones, at least on Eayn.

**Does the government play a large part in peoples’ lives?**

Unlike the other members of the Covenant, the Kig-Yar live as hired guns to the alliance rather than a fully-indoctrinated people. However, the governments of Kig-Yar colonies are typically limited in scope, with the government on Eayn being the most restrictive yet still free enough to facilitate a vast trade empire. Despite this, the Kig-Yar idolize their pirate ancestors as symbols of freedom from the Covenant and their own governments. The supercontinent-spanning governments of Ruuht and Ah’lomet have very little real power, even being referred to as ‘pseudogovernments’.

**Is the culture religious? What are the major religious groups in the region? How do their religious practices differ from their neighbours? Is religion a cause of dissatisfaction, dissension, or hostility in the region?**

A relatively-small portion of the Kig-Yar’s population believed in the [Covenant religion](http://www.halopedia.org/Covenant_religion), operating missionary ships overseen by the [Ministry of Tranquility](http://www.halopedia.org/Ministry_of_Tranquility). Ibie’shans are thought to be more devout believers than other Kig-Yar. The pre-Covenant religions of the Kig-Yar, such as those which placed great significance on [Chu’ot](http://www.halopedia.org/Chu%27ot), were totally wiped out in the time they spent in service of the hegemony. Unlike the [San’Shyuum](http://www.halopedia.org/San%27Shyuum) or Sangheili, the Kig-Yar never worshipped the Forerunners until they were introduced to the Covenant religion. Few Kig-Yar were openly hostile against the Covenant religion.

**What are typical symbols used in the religion and their meanings? Are there any particular places considered special or holy?**

Before the Kig-Yar were introduced to the Covenant religion, some revered Chu’ot as a powerful symbol of their faiths, though this faded as the Covenant religion came to be more accepted by the Kig-Yar. It is possible the symbol of a hook is religiously important to the Kig-Yar, given that their missionary ships are shaped like hooks, a strange design unlike anything else seen in the Covenant.

**What kind of clothes do people wear? How does this vary by season, ethnicity, age, profession, etc.? How is clothing made?**

In the time of the Forerunners and the Conservation Measure, the primitive Kig-Yar did not wear any clothes. In the 26th century, Kig-Yar soldiers were known to wear leotard-like armour which covers, at the most, the torso, crotch, and legs. Almost universally, the Kig-Yar allow their arms, feet, and heads to be exposed. That said, [Kig-Yar Snipers](http://www.halopedia.org/Kig-Yar_Sniper) would wear harnesses or full helmets on their snouts, possibly to give them telescopic vision, and Kig-Yar have been observed with [spaulders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaulders) and [bracers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracer) in battle. It is unknown how civilian Kig-Yar dress, though given their priority on mobility it is likely that it is usually form-fitting and made of aerodynamic polymers.

**What major forms of entertainment are there? Is the populace literate and numerate?**

It seems most Kig-Yar are literate, and given their mercantile culture it is definite that all but a select few would be numerate. Kig-Yar are known to frequent teahouses recreationally, at least in Tilu City. Given Chol Von’s excitement over teaching her son [Laik](http://www.halopedia.org/Laik) the value of delayed gratification, it is likely most Kig-Yar entertainment is immediate and fulfilling.

**Is there a public library system?**

This is unknown, though records of heritage and history are public knowledge to most Kig-Yar, particularly traders.

**Is there any special prestige attached to some category of labour or a particular job? What jobs have few workers and why?**

[Pirates](http://www.halopedia.org/Piracy) are the Kig-Yar’s most idolized profession, and have been since their tribal years on Eayn. Joining the military is also prestigious, especially having a high rank, like [shipmistress](http://www.halopedia.org/Shipmaster), though few shipmistresses existed in the Covenant due to the Covenant military prioritizing Sangheili and Jiralhanae for the position rather than Kig-Yar. Traders also take great pride in their jobs.

**What professions or activities are considered masculine or feminine?**

Positions of power, like shipmasters or clan leaders, are often relegated to females, as is to be expected from a matriarchal society like that of the Kig-Yar. Warriors and other military ground forces seem to be mostly made up of males. Traders and pirates seem to be more egalitarian.

**What shapes are most common in the society’s arts?**

Circles and curves seem to be very important to the Kig-Yar, possibly derived from the shape of their eyes or the shape of Chu’ot, which once held significant religious importance. The shape of the hook, on which their missionary ships are based, may also be common.

**What is the average life expectancy? What access do people have to necessities like clean drinking water and proper sanitation?**

Considering their frail forms and rapid growth to adulthood, the Kig-Yar likely live short lives compared to Humans. Base on their avian bodies, the Kig-Yar may have lifespans similar to those of Earth’s birds, reaching a maximum age sometime around age 80 at maximum and in very rare situations. That the population of Eayn grew steadily and manageably in the aftermath of the fall of the Covenant is a sign that there is a quick overturn, and so likely represents a growth rate barely above 0.00%, perhaps between 0.05% and 0.20%. It would seem that most Kig-Yar have access to affordable healthcare and necessities like drinking water, though luxuries seem to be quite expensive on Eayn.

**How do people react to physical deformity or mental illness?**

The predatory and opportunistic nature of the Kig-Yar would definitely lead to them preying on the weak and incapable. Those suffering from disabilities would be seen as greater opportunities to be exploited than other Kig-Yar.

**How does society define incest? Rape? Are extramarital relationships allowed?**

It is unknown how the Kig-Yar treat incest, but it is not possible for them to engage in rape based on Human definitions, as they require on extra-bodily egg fertilization rather than insertion for sex. It is possible the Kig-Yar do not have a concept of rape. The Kig-Yar are not known to practice marriage, instead treating their partners as mates, a relationship kept together until the female decides she is tired of her male mate.

**Describe the education of the society’s people. Who teaches professions? Between which ages does education happen?**

Kig-Yar education seems to be something that, rather than being done in schools, is done via life experience. Chicks are homeschooled by their parents, and it is likely that young adult Kig-Yar receive apprenticeships from more accomplished Kig-Yar.

**How are year groups and academic years arranged? What is a typical class size?**

Though it is likely the Kig-Yar do not have academic years, they may be aged based on their clutches, which would produce several hatchling chicks in a period of a few hours or days. Thus the “class” would be only as large as a chick’s clutch.

**What is their understanding of death and dying?**

Kig-Yar fear death, and do not view it as honourable, a significant difference from the Sangheili. This has led to them receiving a reputation for cowardice. The fear of death may be linked to them not having any evolutionary measures to directly combat threats, instead being more capable of fleeing than fighting. 

**What does this society do with their corpses?**

This is unknown, but it is possible they practice [endocannibalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannibalism) in order to preserve area for usage by the living and as a means of obtaining meat for a people that are extremely pragmatic and opportunistic.

I disagree.

&gt;Alot of rich kids are very lonely because their parents are too busy with their own lives

Not really. Also, it's not like they can't make other friends.

If anything, rich parents usually have more time to commit towards their children than non-rich parents.

&gt;and they must be wary of moochers constantly, making building genuine friendships/relationships difficult.

That's why they go to private school and meet other rich kids.

&gt;Then there is dynasty. The sons of rich fathers more often than not have insane pressures to succeed. Living up to expectations is very stressful and more often leads to self destructive behavior and mental illness.

Yeah, this isn't really a real thing.

&gt;Children of rich parents who are spoiled early and are not taught the value of hardwork and money like many of their peers 

This is somewhat true, but it's not really a problem.

They all think they are being good. Even when they disown their own son for being gay or try sex conversion therapy on them or something. Or an even better example with Reagan is eliminate state mental institutions so that the mentally ill that can't afford to be treated at a privatized hospital wander the streets homeless and endanger the lives of all citizens. People wonder why mass shootings like Newtown happen more in the USA than in any other developed country. All hail St. Reagan!

PS - while it is maybe relevant that you lived on the South Side of Chicago, I am quite confident you have never experienced anything like the street scene in San Francisco. It isn't criminals that are a problem at this particular intersection, it is the mentally ill and the drug addicted homeless people that are the nuisance. In some ways it is just another obstacle of urban life to work around but in many ways it is very sad, and seeing it day after day on the streets, avoiding human waste, worrying about a confrontation you can't control, and, most profoundly of all, feeling for the people who are living outside, in my opinion, starts to weigh on the psyche and the soul. 

Try it for the summer, but keep your eyes open.

Thanks for the video link.  That was enlightening to hear how this has been tried before and failed.  It's also interesting to consider that the basic strategy is wrong, not the execution.  But then, what is the alternative?  Certainly it's not acceptable to stand by and accept a situation in which the homeless, many due to mental illness, are left to die on the streets.

Did you honestly just compare the police to people who gassed jews, gays, blacks, mentally ill, mentally challenged, gypsies? Not only that made them into slaves of the 20th century.

If you were in LA I would direct you the St Joseph's Center excellent [monetary advisory plan](http://www.stjosephctr.org/monetary_advisory.html) for the homeless and the mentally ill. 

Even if you aren't in LA, I would call them and ask them to help you find a similar service near where you live.

They can help you identify your personal financial goals, negotiate settlements on old debts and figure out how to manage this life saving gift.   Good luck OP.

Those are symptoms of mental illness.  A lot of mental illness, including schizophrenia which afflicts many of the homeless, are treatable.

You act as though this is just the person he is.  But if he got proper therapy and medication, he would be, in terms of his rationality and his ability to consider the world, no different from you or I.

That's what I'm referring to when I talk about getting the homeless the medication that they need to be functional, contributing members of society.  Only in very extreme cases that likely have already resulted in incarceration/hospitalization are people too mentally ill to ever treat.  Most of these people are homeless just because they happen to have conditions (paranoid schizophrenia, for example, where a common delusion is that your Schizophrenia meds are actually mind-control drugs or poison given by people trying to control you in some way) that actively resist treatment.  It's a hurdle, but it is in no way a reason to write them off.

Okay, I agree with a lot of things you have said here, but I have also come to a realization about our respective views. I need to preface this all by saying that I don't know how much of my opinions you have read from other conversations here, so some of this may sound a little redundant. Also, that I don't pretend to lump you in to any category or anything, so if I ever mistakenly use the term 'you will' when I should just be saying 'people will' or when I talk about groups, libertarians, capitalists, etc I am not specifically referring to you personally. I think that one major problem in the disagreement we have is that it is difficult for us to see our own bias that may spring from our respective viewpoints or frameworks, or also where we might self-identify whether the other person knows this or not.

Some of the principles that I try to abide by include a huge emphasis on forgiveness, because to err is human, and because intent and outcome are so rarely coincident. People *usually* have good intentions, but are far too capable of being unable to see all the potential consequences (positive and negative) of how they act on their good intentions. I understand that people will place their own needs in front of others especially when faced with necessity, but I think we do not have a good perspective of our necessity in our country at all. (Of course, people can also be assholes who just want to destroy and self destruct.) I also think that one of the huge things spurring issues in our society stem from our difficulty with figuring out how best to live, now that most of us are not creatures of necessity. Most American lives can be lived relatively comfortably with relatively little effort or work involved. I think we still view abundance and wealth as the utmost importance, when in reality it is no longer the case that more always equals better. The US society specifically puts wealth generated through the use of an *economic tool*, on a godlike pedestal. We absolutely worship money here, and it gets to the point of a mental illness, or a drug addiction. The money is no longer viewed as the simple economic tool that it is, and instead of wealth being the goal, the dollars are the goal... to the point of the detriment of their value. The perspective becomes skewed to a crazy extent. All of this confusion causes the rich and the poor to blame each other for what is just a reality of our current state: They call each other undeserving leeches on society. Are the rich 'to blame' for amassing wealth simply because the poor still exist... does this make them 'selfish'? Are the poor 'to blame' for asking the rich to help them more simply because they are rich...does this make them 'selfish'? Having grown up poor to lower middle class, my perspective has had to learn about the other side: I understand why the rich might  feel that they have earned a right to a life with less effort involved, while the poor have not, regardless of the fact that I have not experienced that feeling myself.

All of this admittedly gives me a measurable amount of bias, some I can recognize, and much I am sure that I am totally unaware of. I am far too trusting of people for my own good, and consequently feel constantly let down by the people around me. This is also a part of the reason I so easily dismiss profit motives and elevate the importance of government, perhaps to an extent that blinds me to the negatives other people *do* experience directly from government. Most of my interactions with government have been positive ones, although I have experienced some very negative ones. I understand fully that many people have probably had vastly more negative experiences with government than positive, and I do not pretend to discount their experience, but also must try to see how this might bias them in their own ways.

The few parts of what you said here that I disagree with, are the ideas about money not being “about the system,” but about people and that there are only individual actors, and I feel I should address those first. While I do understand the truth in saying there are only individual actors and everything else is 'theater', the extent you have taken that truth to ignores other undeniable truths (or at least tends to allow us to set them aside): **Individual actors can come together in groups to accomplish tasks that individual actors can not accomplish alone, and that all of our actions (individual or collective) have consequences beyond the here and now.**

Let me give you a concrete example: One individual actor may have 15,000 automatic rifles that he chooses to sell to another individual actor who happens to have the money to pay for them because he is an African warlord, but that transaction has far reaching consequences that need to be taken into consideration. We can not remove the consequences of the transaction in order to relieve anyone (ourselves or the two individual actors) of the burden of the FACT that there are horrible consequences that come out of putting an arsenal of weaponry into the hands of completely impressionable child soldiers. Similarly, the African warlord can't say, “Well, I just gave the 10 year old the rifle, and told him to shoot it at the people, but he made his own choice... the 10 year old and the people he killed were simply partaking in an interaction independent of me as an actor.” We have influence, and our actions can not be viewed independently. The actors in this example should know that one actor alone can not possibly have use for 15,000 rifles.

I know that a lot of this does not need to be explained to you, like I know you see that individuals can join in groups to accomplish tasks they otherwise would be unable to do, but I think perhaps you lose perspective of what this reality has created. When groups of people join together, the synergy in their combined efforts can be used to accomplish goals that are good and bad, but is is important to realize that the reason any of these groups are corruptible is only because people are corruptible. “Businesses” are not bad by their definition, although that is exactly how some people view them due to their own respective moral values... A business is by definition an organization that wants to provide a person with something that is worth less than they are going to charge you for it in order to amass wealth for themselves. I don't agree with this moral take on business, but I understand it is some people's view. I think businesses can be bad or good, and that even good ones can cause bad things to happen sometimes, even though it is not their intention. Governments are also not bad by definition. Most reasonable people agree (to a point that we must and do refer to it as self evident) that people should have some basic rights and that we want to band together to protect those rights. Simply put: We choose to live by rules. There are natural rules of the world in which our man-made rules must be built, but that is the choice we have made. Some people view governments as inherently 'bad' because of what it is: Governance, forcing people to live by a set of rules. Now, we could get into all sorts of discussions on how or why different forms of governance might employ different forms of law enforcement agencies to carry out this task, but this conversation runs deeper than that. The truth is that if we are going to live by rules, those rules must be enforced, and it is an unfortunate truth of reality that enforcement requires the use of force. This is the sticking point in my conversation with another poster here: He can't get over the fact that in order to have rules we must have enforcement, and because of the nature of enforcement, a part of that is the use of force. Obviously, I don't agree with the view that all use of force of one human to another is bad. I agree with our decision to live by rules, and I realize the pointlessness of trying to argue for a society that never uses force. Perhaps one day, but at this point in time, peaceful utopias are purely fantasy. As a side note, a part of my anger and frustration that I display including coming to this sub to troll comes from that “self-evident” part... Many, if not most of the debates I have with libertarians fall into the category of things that our society only debates in an educational setting: We refer to them as basic human rights, unalienable, self-evident... These are conclusions that are not up for debate in society. We have looked at every angle and tackled every question. (Ours, here, is not one of those debates, but explains perhaps a lot of the more basic stuff that needs to be expressed here, and more of the basis for my perspective.)

I'm very liberal and a vet as well. And I just don't feel the vitriol I see on the military sub and here. I don't know the full story. In fact, part of the company line for joining the military is to protect American's ways of life...including a right to a fair trial. (I get under the ucmj it isn't the same thing, but in theory, I'm not jumping on any bandwagon without fully understanding the circumstances). 

The one thing that screams out at me when I have caught snippets of the accounts from the investigation or from his peers - mental illness. And let's not pretend that the military doesn't prey on disadvantaged populations to gain enlistments. The guy was obviously troubled. 

Just my humble opinion. 


Edit - also I heard an analyst on npr yesterday say that most likely, he will not get any prison time for all this for a variety of reasons. I see so much passion here from people against this kid, and I am bracing myself for the Obummer bashing when the whole thing plays out.

Yes, many many homeless have mental illness but they are also raging alcoholics. They are not turning down your food (bananas, hotdogs, etc) because they are picky or it would upset their stomach but because they want money so they can go to the liquor store and buy a fifth of vodka or a  drug dealer and get their next hit. 

The lack of real professional help available to our homeless is shameful and pathetic. You can tell a lot about a society by how they treat their poor.

Those guys are mentally ill. I'm white and I'm not even bad-looking, matter of fact I look beter and more youthful than the average 20-something even tho I have nearly 10 years on them. And yet I was rejected non-stop by every woman, white, black, Asian, old and young, hot and ugly, thin and obese.

Great social skills + great sense of style + great sense of humor, plenty of female friends, but women are simply not sexually attracted to me. Relatively skinny, 5'7'' so that's probably my problem in getting laid.

I know I have no shot with any women and yet I'm living and breathing and emotionally healthy. Those kids like Elliot Rodger and that Asian guy are entitled people who think they are worthy of women. Only the best-looking men are worthy of women.

Looks like you're on Reddit, which I assume you have a job now? So how hard was it to get a minimum wage job? Which will give you food and shelter and than work your way up to other opportunities. Why can't all the other homeless be like you, why can't they do that. If they have mental illnesses than they should see a doctor. I'm talking about the majority of homeless you see on the streets buying alcohol, drugs, cigarettes with their money, they are not disabled or suffer mental illnesses, just lazy

A lot of those people have mental disabilities through no choice of their own. 

"Approximately 20 - 25% of the single adult homeless population suffers from some form of severe and persistent mental illness (National Resource and Training Center on Homelessness
and Mental Illness, 2003)."

Or there could have been a thousand other circumstances that led to their condition.

The amount of ignorance shown by that manager is astounding. People assume the worst of the homeless, assume that they are mentally ill and assume the mentally ill all engage in antisocial or criminal behavior. He's wrong in a number of ways. I'll be he also assumes rich people never break the law.

The system is what's bad. It's corrupt, inhumane, and violent. And if you are it's enforcer, no matter how much of a noble person you might be in your private life, you are part of that system. 

I've encountered a lot of cops in my time. Do I hate them as individuals? No. But of the best ones I've met one thing that always pops into my head is "*why the fuck are doing this shit?*"

Frankly, there's very little justification for the vast majority of what police get up to. They essentially exist to prey on the poor and marginalized for the state. And of "good cops" the only thing I can get from their position is that they're incredibly misguided about what their actual job is. Nobody likes to admit that, on a societal level, they're the "bad guy". Nobody. So of course they'll pretend that this shit is necessary or that they're the only thing standing between us and chaos, but it's not the truth. In fact for most of human history police didn't exist. And society didn't collapse. Modern police forces are a new thing, we need to remember that. And when they were first instituted they were met by massive resistance from the population. Because they all knew what was up. They knew it was a way for the state to exert authority on them and they didn't want it. 

So these "good cops" buy into this narrative that cops are always on the right side of history, that we need them around constantly, and that regular people can't take care of their own problems themselves. The world isn't perfect, but most people are not violent murderers in waiting. And frankly what we call "justice" in this country is usually anything but. 

So they buy into this narrative and they end up serving a fundamentally unjust social order that realistically has far less value then we like to pretend. And then they don't question it. They'll chuck a guy into prison for years for smoking a joint, they'll do a no knock raid on your house and accidentally shoot your daughter, they'll harass that homeless guy in the park who's just looking for a place to sleep, they'll tazer the mentally ill and chuck them into a cell rather then getting them help, they'll don riot gear and break up demonstrations, no matter how just. And they won't question it. Because they think they *need* to do it. Because this is what "justice" looks like. Because this is how you "help people". 

And ya know, I believe that. I believe most cops seriously got into that shit because they wanted to help their communities. And that's a great thing. That's a good and noble impulse. But they directed it towards something that serves the total opposite ends, and that ends up making life all the more shitty and dangerous for millions of people. These people are misguided at best and don't understand the ramifications of much of what they do. And more then that, they don't even *want* to understand. Because that would mean admitting you're not a force for good but one of repression. And who wants that?

We need to break this narrative. We need to look at what's actually happening around us and what it's a part of instead of copying the view of society you get from hollywood action movies or police union officials.
