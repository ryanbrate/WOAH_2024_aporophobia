This is a pet issue with the right wing. It allows them to look tough on government spending, while continuing to support an economic agenda which siphons wealth out of the middle class and kicks it up to the one percent. Everything the Republicans do is designed to make the rich richer at the expense of everyone else. And only a dumb bigot thinks drug testing people on food stamps is going to make things better.

Thank you for that delightfully anecdotal story, and by anecdotal I mean bullshit and worthless. They kick you off of these plans at the drop of a hat, work is a component of welfare, and if you can't find a job you have a limited timeframe during which you are also expected to participate in job training and demonstrate your job hunt. 

The big question is of course why anyone would risk a felony to save twenty bucks on their groceries, you haven't thought this through at all.

Poor people arn't on drugs, that was already demonstrated repeatedly with the the drug testing measures being passed in various red states.

Sorry but if you think that someone on welfare should have the choice to have another kid you are dumb. I don't advocate making it illegal but we should give them all birth control and take them off welfare if it doesn't show up in their system when they get drug tested. That would cost far less overall than any policy I have seen.

Good business moves are amoral.  Google's former policy of do whatever Friday's allowed them to rapidly expand their software offerings, and cull the field after it had been discovered which ones people cared about.  I'd bet that there's a clause in the employment contract that says "whatever you build on Google's time is Google's stuff."  They traded eight hours a week for ownership of everyone's pet projects, and increased productivity during the week to boot.  Fantastic business move, and I've not heard one person call them out for being flexible regarding work hours.

Also, look at things a different way.  Everything a large company does, moral or immoral, is being done because someone believes it to be a good business move.  We don't hear about things unless they're close to an edge of the bell curve, morally.  We don't hear "mid level manager fired for sexual harassment" or "call center employee fails drug test."  The only things that really matter are things that happen with the top executives' blessings, and that are either extremely immoral, or extremely altruistic.  Bill Gates has dedicated himself to spending his giant piles of cash curing diseases in poor places.  Luxottica used disproportionate industry size to crush Oakley into submission.  

The difference is that Bill Gates is a person, who can do whatever he wants with his stuff, and Luxottica is a publicly traded company with a legally binding contract saying they have to do what they can to maximize shareholder value.

Sounds like you have the right attitude and that your priorities are in the right place.

/r/daddit and /r/trees dad weighing in: Quitting smokin' is very do-able, and should be done now in your case.  Here's why: 

* **Legal reasons**  Until your state follows mine (WA), it's illegal and can cause you big trouble.  Sure, when you were single and carefree, it didn't matter too much, because you were only responsible for yourself.  Reading your post, it's pretty obvious that you already feel the weight of responsibility for these two other humans, so you understand this reasoning.  And this is a good thing!

* **Getting over it now**  If you're a heavy user like I was, you'll be irritable (and frankly, irritating!), frustrated, and just in general kind of cranky for a few weeks as your brain/body sort themselves out.  Cannabis is awesome, but heavy usage does change your brain's biochemistry, and it will take a little bit of time to get used to.  And, quite frankly, if you've been dealing with anxiety and other unwanted feelings by getting high, you'll need to learn how to deal with those feelings like a big boy.  It's not easy, believe me.  But it's totally do-able!

* **Getting clean for a job search**  You mentioned the pressure to get a "real job"; many of those will require drug tests.  If you're going for a "real job" that requires hair drug tests, the test is for the last 3 months, and even a UA can detect cannabis usage from 28+ days.  

* **Saving money** Reading between the lines, you and your fiancee come from well-off families, so this one might not matter as much in your particular case.  But cannabis can be expensive, if you like smoking the sticky-icky, especially in your part of the world where it's slightly harder to come-by.  Regardless of the price, consuming it multiple times daily, on the daily, adds up.  That's a lot of potential diapers and baby-food you're smokin', champ!  :-)

* **Keeping mama happy**  It may be that your fiancee is a little peeved that she "had to" stop smoking due to the pregnancy, but you're still getting to do it.  Or it may be that she has just changed her opinion of it now that she's a mother.  I've heard that the way it usually goes is women feel maternal when they first feel the baby move inside them, and men get paternal when they actually see the baby for the first time outside of the womb.  *That's not always the case: my wife and I suffered a miscarriage with our first (and unplanned) pregnancy and were both incredibly heartbroken, and then thrilled when we got her pregnant again a month later.*

* **Staying motivated, eyes on the prize, etc.**  I found myself abusing cannabis, rather than just using it, and found it limited my motivations to make all the positive changes in myself and the world that I deeply desire to make.  A lot of people seem to be able to be very productive while smokin', and more power to them.  I couldn't; some others can't.  Becoming a parent is life-changing, literally, and can turn a slacker into one motivated motherfucker.  Don't let cannabis sap that from you!

So, a few bits of advice on what to do instead: 

* **Hit the gym**  I don't know if you already work out (Do you even lift, bruh?), but exercising will give you a nice brain-chemistry boost naturally, dopamines and serotonins, that will help your itchy brain chillax.

* **Find a productive hobby**  By productive, I mean something that adds value to your life.  Write.  Paint.  Play music (not listen-to!  Play!!).  Start playing a sport.  Garden (Calm down buddy, we're quitting the 'erb, you remember?!).  *In my case, I realized I'm an entrepreneur, and so spend my free time learning/studying/planning/doing how to launch my own startup.*

* **Cook, or learn to cook**  Cannabis leads to fast food, or quick and often unhealthy food.  Stereotype, sure, but stereotypes are based in reality.  Fat guy used to the drive-thru, weighing in (Get it?!).  Cooking is healthier, cheaper, and takes some time.  Cooking together can be a great bonding experience for you and your lady, or a super-sweet thing to do for her while she puts her swollen ankles up and relaxes on the couch watching Netflix.  

* **Learn something new**  Think about all the time you spent smoking and high.  Great times, sure, and you no doubt had a lot of great conversations or crazy thought tangents that were amazing.  I know I did!  Now imagine that you spent that much time learning something(s) new!  Contrary to popular belief, [it only takes 20 hours to learn a new skill](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/05/30/josh-kaufman-it-takes-20-hours-not-10000-hours-to-learn-a-skill/), not 10,000.  Make yourself a better person, and you'll become a better husband and father as well.

* **Spend time with your baby**  They grow up so fast, dude.  It seems like only yesterday we were spending our 30-something-th hour at the hospital, waiting for our little guy.  Now he's almost 21 months, and he is SOOOO much bigger, smarter, awful (he's precociously into his Terrible Twos already), amazing, mobile, loving, and everything else.  And I know from other parents that this telescoping nature of time only seems to accelerate.  I mean, think about it like this: how long did 1st grade seem to take?  And how fast did your senior year of high school go?  So put that time you would have spent getting high and playing CoD (or whatever, I dunno, last console I owned was N64) to good use!  Time really does seem to fly by the older we get, so enjoy every second you can with your little dude! 

Okay, I've procrastinated doing work for long enough now; I hope this helped!  PM me if you have any desire to, or need perspective or understanding as you work through this transitional time.  And remember to focus on taking care of your mama bear, and y'alls cub, because it's always easy (and perfectly natural!) to focus on ourselves, but a good papa bear has to look out for his family, too!  Love them with all your heart, and the rest will follow.

Good luck!

&gt; Liberals need to step up and do their own 'charity'.

It's not as much about charity as it is efficiency and constitutionality. Is it really worth spending millions of dollars just to find the less than one percent of welfare recipients who test positive for drugs? Is that really a good use of your dime?

Furthermore, the courts have ruled that testing welfare recipients without suspicion is a violation of their constitutional rights. States are finding ways to skirt this issue, but it's still not turning up enough drug users to justify the cost.

Really, the only positive that comes out of drug testing welfare recipients is the soothing of conservatives' delicate sensibilities.

They dont hate em, they need em. They gut taxes, saying revenues will soar(which only happens when taxes are way too high which they arent)

and then when the deficits pile up they need someone to blame, and its the black woman with 2 kids eating steaks while driving a cadillac to the local strip club to get a tat.. and thats what ALLL of them are like.

America is actually richer than it was when your parents were around. Per PERSON AND ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION we are twice as rich as in 1968. 2 times as much.. and yet min wage workers still get paid less than they did back then. And people feel in theri bones we are poor. HEre is a state in americas the super power, cutting back on fucking tanf? Well WE GOT TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS HUH. and the kochs need a new poney farm for their little girl.


ramble off.. it is a good article and yeah it is hilarious when they have framed the workers of society as living off the good graces of the rich. WE got to give the rich more so they can help all us out more.. SO WE CAN EXTRACT a little of their income to pay for our bread.

But like the article shows its actually the exact opposite. The rich live off our labor hours.  They extract from our work and our calories wealth which they graciously let us keep a fraction of.(and whats kinda worse is a lot of that wealth generation comes from past labor hours which continue to pay the rich..society is slowly seeing the rich live more and more off past labor hours as the means of change gets automated. you know that whole "you didnt build this" that the right flipped out about. But like it or not society is built on the efforts of those who came before us. And I dont care how smart you are, or withdrawn from society.. you dont build shit yourself. Nope all our knowledge and society comes from the past labor hours of our citizens.


Last, I think in especially RED STATES, we need to have a class in HS that teaches people how to be poor and what it is ACTUALLY LIKE. People have this misconception of a vacation, when not only do you make less but you work harder. The poor tend to not have all the modern conveniences. They do their own dishes by hand, they take the bus to the laundrymat. They cant order in bulk .. which allows them to wait for sales. Its expensive and time consuming as all fuck to be poor. 

(edit: felt this needed to be said, and really should be brought up more in this backwards ass states, the idea of banning the poor from buying steaks and seafood, will actually cost teh state a ton of money while not really doing much of shit. They have to redo the entire system servicing stores, they have to train stores, and then do oversignt of stores and strain the food stamp recipients... it used to be expensive as fuck to have our blue laws, as stores and employees had a hard time knowing what you could buy and sell on sundays.. like yogurt was fine, ice cream wasnt.. in my town, a beach shovel was fine, a garden shovel wasnt. Will slim jims be ok? what about tofu steak? fake crab? nah the rigth once again like drug testign teh poor are actually going to waste the states money going after a minority of users problem)

&gt; FYI I'm a Libertarian, so it should tell you something if even someone like me is fine with drug testing in exchange for Federal aid

but in any case, your ideology doesn't make your argument stronger.

I don't assume all minimum wage workers are, but those who have made a career out of positions designed to be temporary and aimed at teenagers and students get no sympathy from me. You don't see the college students who work at McDonald's walking off the job to protest for higher wages. I find people who rely on others to support them instead of bettering themselves and the lives of their family's to be incredibly lazy. I don't support our current welfare because it incentivized people to not work. It baffles me how I had to get drug tested to take a corporate job and EARN money while its "unconstitutional" to force welfare recipients to get drug tested to be GIVEN money someone else earned.

No one likes governmental bureaucracy and waste. Any time you impose restrictions or requirements on a government program, you increase the standard bureaucracy (and cost) of the program. Some bureaucracy may be necessary and pen out as money saving when preventing massive levels of fraud, but no one can doubt (especially business owners) the frustration and difficulty of constantly jumping through convoluted hoops for the most basic things. Drug testing isn't some simple thing you can do at the library computer like normal financial documentation of your poverty.

With drug testing, you're once again imposing even greater difficulty in acquiring a basic governmental service. Welfare is not some huge handout; it's the most basic and low level assistance we have with very low levels of fraud. No one on welfare is scamming the government; they're barely getting by and already have to constantly prove they're barely getting by. The government often spends more money on preventing fraud for its various programs than the cost savings justify (the VA is a very good example of this where the verification of health care needs and services costs significantly more than the fraud it prevents). Of course, welfare is not a program to stop people from using drugs.

A bigger issue is how to effectively give people assistance. You're not helping anyone who's on drugs by taking away their money. If they're truly an addict, they're either going to need help with their treatment or they're just going to commit low level crimes to get the drugs. Maybe you spend marginally less on welfare (although the evidence does not show savings so far), but you're going to increase property crimes (and possibly worse crimes) by the same amount. [Housing first](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_First) policies are a good example of how being overly discriminating in whom you help can lead to worse more expensive outcomes. Every study regardless of the metropolitan area has shown that giving everyone who is homeless no strings attached housing is actually cheaper for the city/state than otherwise. Housing those in extreme poverty (and only housing them, this doesn't include what added services could help with) reduces their crime rate, reduces their medical expenses, and reduces their drug use.

First go to a detox center when there ask about the rehab options in your area. Tere are some rehabs and treatment centers that give you an apartment that you get checked on every so often you have group therapy they structure your time and help you get a job. You get drug tested they teach you life skills and such. If you think that is a level you'd be safe at look at that. It's hard going from homeless to not I mean it's great, but I did it and sometimes it's like you forgot what it's like to not be homeless. They can help with that transition. Good luck.

&gt;  it sounds like we're all basically fucked in our own respective circumstances then

Not really at all. The bankers in a way are particularly troubled because their "predicament" (which they relish in, just like the biggest thugs in the ghetto) leaves them with a lot of power - imposing change on them is VERY difficult. It's a situation where 

&gt; I guess I might choose investment banking over the ghetto. 

It is the obvious choice. Your power over your contextual circumstances might not be much better than in the ghetto, and you will have way less free time than you'd have in the ghetto, but your lifestyle will be order of magnitude better AND you have basically a pass in to heaven if you break out (whereas the ghetto breakout just gets you a shot at working hard).

The main points in a way I'm thinking of are these:      
a) If we just hope that the investment banking culture improves on itself, we'll almost certainly be disappointed. Ditto the "thugs" if you will.       
b) Just moralizing from the sidelines won't do very much. Saying that the bankers shouldn't use obscure facts to make themselves wealthy won't do squat. If drug dealing and being a thug makes you money AND gets you laid, moaning about it and expecting people to rally their willpower to stop doing that (despite the obvious benefits) is ridiculously naive.      

What you have to do is change the environment. It's harder to deal with what gets you laid, but money is often involved in that too, and we can certainly limit how much money can be made by illicit means. Biggest single step here is legalizing drugs, because that'll kill that route completely.

Also some sort of benefits reform would be useful that would massively encourage working and joining the mainstream society (not mandatory drug tests and other bs, but perhaps paying people for good grades and that sort of thing - it's done in some other countries after all and in some areas of the US too)

You rally against "free" stuff. But somehow keep missing the obvious.

In other countries with "free" healthcare, they spend less than we do here. 

In America, we spend more on healthcare (purely from taxes) than all but 3 other countries.

THEN we all have to buy insurance

THEN we have to actually pay to see doctors and get things done.

So you prefer having more of your money taken both by taxes and by private corporations, instead of less of your money and less of everyone else's money?

How exactly do you win?

Is it safe to assume you also want drug testing for welfare recipients even though that also costs more of your money?

The reason that a lot of our welfare systems don't work is that they are over burdened by people who don't need it. They deemed it an invasion of privacy to drug test them for God's sakes. 

And I can empathize. I've been there before, and I was able to make it through. It was hard, and I never want to go through it again. I was homeless for a spell. I have sympathy for these people but the reality is you can't help anyone more than they're willing to help themselves.

&gt; drug testing for welfare is against their rights

Whether it's against their rights or not, it's a hilarious and terrible waste of money.  It was perhaps worth a try... but pick a state that tried it and look how it turned out.  Utah, for example, spent $30,000 testing and found just 12 people who didn't qualify.  Nearly every state that tried it discovered that people on welfare are actually *much* less likely to use drugs than the general population.  To use Utah's numbers again, 0.2% of their welfare recipients use drugs, while 6% of Utah's general population uses drugs.  Florida similarly found that their welfare users were a quarter as likely to use drugs than Florida's overall population, and similarly spent more money testing than was saved in avoided welfare payments to drug users.

It just isn't financially worthwhile to do it, and on top of that, it's apparently a group that is much less likely to be using drugs.

So... rights aside, drug testing for welfare eligibility just doesn't make any practical sense.

&gt; It also seems real crappy that you would have to tell someone that these kind of choices are not what that assistance is meant for.

Would you? Or is this just more demonizing of the poor based on nothing factual?

I'm sure there is someone somewhere wasting their funds, but how big is this problem? 0.1%? 0.0001%? Do they have any data backing up their position?

It seems like every time the GOP comes up with there solutions it's for problems that don't actually exist, but have great political payoff. See drug testing people on welfare. Or "fixing" voting fraud by literally ignoring 99.9999% of voting fraud but making it real hard for the poor, elderly, disabled and minorities to vote.

The company had to pay him back-pay for three years and give him his job back with no loss in seniority. Go Teamsters !

I am a teacher and I discovered that a group of my students have been engaging in a systematic and innovative campaign of criminal acts. SOCIETY NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS SO THIS DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR CAN BE PREVENTED. I discovered in the possession of a student a lengthy manual that describes how him and his friends had been accruing vast amounts of wealth and power in my city.

The name of their system is called the “proxy method”. In their criminal hierarchy, there are two groups. The “hosts”, who anonymously control a vast and complex web of criminal activities, and the “proxies”, who are paid to follow the host's instructions. When recruiting a proxy, the host sends them an anonymous email over social media inviting them to download a special app on their phones. The app has been designed by host computer science agents to be a covert method of communication. The app appears to be a run of the mill role playing game, but is actually a way for the proxies to receive encrypted instructions from their superiors. The app records and sends location information, and can activate the camera and microphone of the smart phone remotely. The hosts also utilize a network of web-enabled cameras, microphone bugs,and drones to monitor the state of their criminal operations.

Their are three types of proxies. There are regular proxies, who could have any background or appearance (young, old, male, female, etc). Their job is mainly the transportation of brown-bagged packages between specific drop points. The hosts instruct them where to pick up the packages, and who to transport them to. The proxies are completely unaware of the contents of the package, which could be drugs, firearms, or cash. They can also be involved in 'cutting' drugs, acting as “bystander” or “witness” decoys, or aiding in theft operations. The next type of proxies are enforcers, tall bodybuilders and ex-military agents who provide protection for other proxies and sometimes use lethal force against the enemies of the crime syndicate. Enforcers are dispatched via their smart phone apps to specific locations where they are needed. The third type of proxies are honey pots. These are men and women who are considered very sexually attractive. They act as prostitutes or as bait.

The hosts are a secret group of people who never reveal their identities to the proxies. This makes it difficult for the police to prosecute them or infiltrate the operation. The hosts control the proxies remotely from a constantly moving base of operations, located in gated subdivisions or exclusive highrise condominiums. Only during an initiation ceremony, where a proxy moves up and joins the ranks of the hosts, do the hosts meet the proxy face to face. To be promoted to a host, the proxy must first pass a test of loyalty. They are instructed to arrive at a large apartment building. Their smartphone app instructs them to open a specific mailbox in the lobby that is unlocked. Inside is an envelope containing a memory inhibiting drug, which they must ingest. After waiting sufficient time in the lobby for the drug to take effect, they are escorted to one of the apartments for a meeting with a team of hosts. They are interrogated about any possible connections with the police or with rival criminal operations. If they pass, they are inducted into the ranks of the hosts.

The manual has outlined the various ways that the criminal operation acquires wealth:

1. Honey Pot Dealer Scam
The hosts search through public records and online databases to find wealthy individuals who live in the city. A team of honeypot proxies are dispatched to a location where they will cross paths with the target (i.e. a restaurant, bar, or store). There are instructed to make sexual advances to the target, and eventually propose that they return to the target's home to hold a “party”. The proxies will have picked up a package of amphetamines, cocaine, and GHB at a drop point before meeting with the target. When they get back to the target's home, they will initiate a days-long drug-fueled series of sexual escapades. When the target has ingested enough drugs to develop an addiction, the next stage of the operation is initiated. The proxies will tell the target that they have run out of drugs and will need to buy more. The hosts will dispatch another proxy (with drugs) to the target's home. These drugs will be sold to the target for 10-100x the street value of the substances. The target will continue to be sold overpriced drugs at a rate that sustains their addiction without compromising their ability to make money or fulfill the duties of their job. A proxy is assigned to the target as a handler. This proxy will pose as the target's “assistant” or girlfriend, and accompany the target to their job and on social occasions. The ostensible reason for this is that the proxy would be romantically interested in the target, while also would be their connection for purchasing drugs to fuel their addiction. Eventually, the proxy would bury deeper and deeper into the target's personal life. They would take control of the target's finances so that they can pump funds directly into the rest of the criminal organization.
2. Chain Invasion
In this scam,the criminal organization invades a chain store or restaurant and take control of it. Proxies are instructed to all apply for positions at a specific location, to the point that every potential employee that is interviewed is actually a proxy. Over time, more and more proxies are hired by the company and move up into manager positions so that they can hire more proxies. At this point, the store or restaurant is converted into an outpost of criminal activity. For example, drive-thru fast food restaurants are used as packaging and distribution points for illicit drugs. Retail stores are used to resell stolen merchandise. Funds are skimmed from the operating costs of the business, and cash from drug dealing is laundered through the business.
3. Knock-Off Designer Drugs
One of the most insidious activities that the criminal operation has undertaken in my city is the creation of knock-off designer drugs. They purvey a wide range of psychoactive substances that are purported to be new drugs that are distinct from the others commonly available on the market. Instead, the substances they sell are actually just mixes of different drugs and other substances. Just in the past month in my school, we have had to confiscate hundreds of vials of a blue powder labeled “AquaFrost-13”, and a black powder labeled “Carbon-G9-Prismatic”. I was horrified to find a bottle of the former in my daughter's purse. I immediately had her drug tested, and the results showed she had small amounts of cocaine, amphetamines, oxycontin, and MDMA in her system! Just from smelling the bottle I could tell there was some sort of candy sugar and menthol in it as well.
4. Flash Job
This criminal activity has been all over the local news in my city. Dozens of proxies are instructed to converge on a specific mall or big-box store. They first pick up a wig or baseball hat a drop point. Two specific proxies pick up packages of low-intensity flash bang grenades or fireworks. The proxies progressively fill the store until almost all the customers are criminal agents. At a specific time (for example, 6:13 pm), the proxies position themselves in front of an expensive piece of merchandise. At the set time, the two special proxies set off the firework diversion. The rest of the proxies grab their target merchandise and rush towards the store exit, pretending to flee from the fireworks that they think is a bomb. The proxies get into their cars and take off their disguises, leaving before the police arrive. The merchandise they acquire is resold in chain stores that are controlled by the criminal organization.

These criminal behaviors are a sickening affront to our society. We must protect ourselves against these horrible students by educating others about their misdeeds. Please tell EVERYONE you know what they are doing.

I used to work at a homeless shelter, and seeing homeless people on the streets absolutely tugs at my heart strings.

&gt; The fact is, drugs are illegal.

And **why** are they illegal?  Why is marijuana illegal, when it kills, oh, maybe **zero** Americans a year, while alcohol and tobacco are **legal**, yet kills *tens* and *hundreds* of thousands of Americans every year?

Using "drugs are illegal" as a talking point is incredibly ignorant and useless.  The only important reason marijuana is illegal, for example, is because legalizing it would take money away from Big Pharma, Big Alcohol, Big Tobacco, private prisons, police unions, and prison guard unions, each of which lobby **hard** to keep it illegal.  You want sensible drug policy, look up Portugal.

&gt;  I think welfare shouldn't be about helping and being nice, it's an investment.

So then why do you want to *waste* money on drug tests when 99.5% of people on welfare aren't using (or, if they are, they're smart enough to avoid using around drug test time)?  Current welfare and social programs do **not** help people on welfare rise out of poverty.  Better wages, better hours, labour unions, universal health care, better public schools (rather than raping them to create "charter schools" whose outcomes are no better), better public transit, better housing ... you want to help people on welfare rise out of poverty, **those** are the places you invest.

As for "make sure they aren't using their money on **illegal** things," then why does the US government subsidise Big Oil to the tune of billions every year, when they break laws with impunity on a regular basis?  Sauce for the goose....

The cartridges all are typically BHO mixed with some sort of oil. 

I do not want THC. I am to be drug tested as a condition of probation (For a non-drug offense. Go figure) so those are not an option for me. I'm aware of all the CBD oils out there which I am not opposed to, but none of them have a cannabis taste to them. 


Just to reiterate, I am looking for nicotine liquids. Not a THC vaporizer.

If you'd like to join the CIA, FBI, etc. you take a drug test and you can't even have a desk job if you fail.

Google, Apple, Oracle, Intel, and all the leading R&amp;D firms generally do not test for psychedelics. Think about that.

There's also the case for Mullis, Crick, etc. and all the scientists who haven't come out yet because they're afraid. I personally know scientists, teachers and the like who can't "come out" although they are not world famous like the nobel-prize winning Crick, I know. But even Crick didn't talk about it while he was alive. 

These are not hippies who think they unlocked the mystery of the universe but intelligent, responsible people who use arguably the most powerful tools known to modern man in order to actually examine these "mysteries" in a scientific way.

They also might happen to be hippies. 

In my personal opinion, the same argument you made could be made for teenagers and alcohol, social networks, or any age group and any drug (cocaine for example....talk about Hollywood)  *or activity* that's stimulating but can be unhealthy and addictive. Psychedelics aren't addictive.

Also, it seems like the people you talk about annoy you. Blacks annoy racist people. Go ahead and be annoyed. I'm not trying to defend drugs. I have huge respect for psychedelics but making an effort to see where other people are coming from instead of just being annoyed by them will always be more important to me than any kind of drug-related debate. And let me tell ya man acid did help me get to this place.

**it's a terrible idea to try and hijack a film thread to make a policy point. That's why your being down-voted** Hint, go create this post on a relevant subreddit or personal blog

now because i'm interested in this sort of stuff i'll give you a brief substantive answer. 1. we would see a lot more indirect screaning by race. For instance consider that people with "black" names are discriminated against in studies about job hiring/callbacks and other studies show mandatory drug tests actually reduce racial hiring bias. Essentially you can't create race blind outcomes by hiding race. It eliminates some barriers but since people have the same predispositions and mental images they will rely on proxys to achieve the same goal (for instance hiring the best workers) and thus giving them less information will help some but hurt others. 


&gt;Black employment in the testing sector is suppressed in the absence of testing, a finding which is consistent with ex ante discrimination on the basis of drug use perceptions. Adoption of pro-testing legislation increases black employment in the testing sector by 7-30% and relative wages by 1.4-13.0%, with the largest shifts among low skilled black men. Results further suggest that employers substitute white women for blacks in the absence of testing. ND economist Wosnizac

While I am very much for drug testing for welfare recipients I always think it's important to understand the other side of the argument.

The basic idea is that just because someone is addicted to drugs is no reason to allow them to starve to death.  Moreover, people deprived of welfare aren't going to make the decision between drugs or food... they'll make the decision to have drugs *and* food through crime.

 Alright, feel free to copy-paste this for your inevitable future arguments on drug testing for welfare recipients, because apparently this matter can't/won't die.

1. This is unconstitutional. Period. The fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches without probable cause. There is nothing vague about this. For those who try to counter about private businesses drug testing, those are -private- entities and are not beholden to parts of the constitution that specifically target the government's actions.
This argument SHOULD stop here, because the constitution is -about- as baseline as we can get, however, just for the sake of thoroughness, let's hit all the areas.

2. This is ineffective. In Florida, 2011, for four months, they tried this exact thing, finding that just 2.6% of potential welfare recipients tested positive for drugs. This meant that the cost of drug testing was higher than the money saved by refusing welfare to those 2.6%.
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/us/florida-law-on-drug-testing-for-welfare-is-struck-down.html?_r=1

3. Affordable drug testing (urine/blood) is fundamentally unqualified for the desired outcome that policies like this are purporting to seek. Addictive drugs (meth, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, etc.) stay in the body for a few days or less, whereas cannabis, a non-addictive substance, lasts in the body for weeks, meaning that the tests will largely produce positive results for marijuana users rather than abusers of addictive substances. Furthering this is the fact that marijuana is significantly easier to obtain and is less expensive than most other illicit drugs.

4. No study exists to show that depriving drug addicts of state safety nets causes them to rise out of their addiction any quicker or any more easily. By contrast, the more financially desperate an addict becomes, the more likely they are to turn to crime, a significantly worse outcome than state funding. And in fact, the only good way to stop drug use is to provide services for drug rehabilitation and also supervise/guide people in the program. https://ncadd.org/learn-about-drugs/drugs-and-crime. Long term planning and services to reduce drug addiction are estimated to save $4,000-12,000 per client per year due to decreased prison costs as well as other social costs that arise from helping to care for addicts.

5. Most people have paid into taxes for most of their lives, giving them the same rights to a social safety net when they need it as you.

6. There are already checks and balances in place for case workers to catch, prevent, and disincentivize drug use among welfare recipients. Case workers know who has been barred from potential employment due to substance abuse, and there are stringent regulations on continuously seeking employment in order to remain on welfare. The policy of drug testing welfare recipients is made almost entirely redundant by the regulations already in-place by states.

7. Leaving aside all of this science, sociological data, historical data, and legal data- leaving aside all of those obvious reasons why this is a terrible policy- it's a simple matter of ethics: Care for your neighbor during the times in which they need it the most. It would be a sad thing if they chose to use their welfare money on drugs (again, noting the previous points in this post), but ultimately, is that your concern? It's incredibly difficult to remain on welfare indefinitely, and if someone's going to use their allotted portion of the safety net in a way that is irresponsible, isn't that their problem rather than ours? Our obligation as citizens is to make sure people have that net. Our obligation as a society is to decreases the need for that safety net, but keeping addicts off of welfare doesn't satisfy either of those. Keeping addicts off of welfare doesn't actually -help- anyone. It expends an incredible amount of time, energy, and money in order to make a very small percentage of people even more desperate, destitute, and distressed than they were before.

So, with all that in mind, is it worth it?

More importantly, WHY is it worth it? Choose your words carefully, because you better have some incredibly compelling numbers to back up what you're about to say.

You posted in a very respectful way, so I want to comment in a manner that is similarly respectful and not insulting or condescending. 

Simply put, the reason there are two main reasons this is a bad idea: reason number one is the simpler one--it doesn't really save money. These types of programs have been tried multiple times (notably in Florida, but a few other states, Utah maybe?) and they didn't work. It ended up *costing* the taxpayers money because the savings from the amount of people who tested positive and were denied benefits were far less than the cost of implementing the program.

In fact, in Florida, governor Rick Scott (who championed the law) also helped found and is the controlling shareholder for a chain of walk-in clinics that would be among the places performing the drug tests, so it makes you wonder why he was so gung-ho about it.

The second reason that this is a bad idea is because the people who overwhelmingly benefit from food stamps are children. Even in a world where most SNAP recipients are drug addicts, denying the benefits to their parents disproportionately punishes their children who don't have any say in being born to addict, low-income families.

5.6 is also artificially low say's the ceo of gallup. Now whether the story is fabricated or not I do not know. The point is that you should be doing whatever possible to not increase your spending while on welfare. Welfare should not be so comfortable that you are ok with being on it. There are plenty of jobs available that higher from within where you can move up the ladder to a career. Factory's in iowa higher anyone who walks through the door and as long as you don't fail a drug test or miss too much work your at 15/hr with benifit's, 401k , and profit sharing in a year. With good attendance and work ethic you can work your way through Walmart or target. People just feel that starting out at a cashier's job is beneath them and they don't deserve that. Yes there are some professionals that do not have jobs and have a hard time finding work but the unemployment rate of IT professionals is less then 1 percent and engineers is at like 4% i cant comment on the rest but i guarantee none of those professionals laid off are having the convo with their SO about having another kid while unemployed and are on sites like monster and LinkedIn looking for jobs daily.

Some people just have an ideology block.  They can't accept the idea that lazy people might get "free stuff".  It's why, even when the cost to the state is far greater, they still insist on drug testing people on welfare.

Edited for longer rant.

Crazy, he says our poor are the envy of the world. But what world exactly? I don't think there are many poor in Europe that would rather be poor in the US. Sure, living in the wealthiest country in the world leaves the poor here better off than those in Nigeria, but wouldn't it be more desirable if the poor in the US were better off than than the least well off in our peer nations? Or better yet, wouldn't it be great if we could actually work on eliminating poverty all together? 

But Issa wouldn't want that. How can you justify cutting inheritance taxes, and cutting food stamp benefits if reducing poverty was your goal? You do it by trying to convince the poor that they have already have it good. And the Republican's favorite strategy, convincing people that it's "other" poor people that make everyone poor. And if you think that doesn't make sense, you're right. But this is the famous "welfare queen" argument. That the system is rife with freeloaders, and people sucking off the government teat, who are too lazy and drug addled to get up and get a job. 

Except those poor people don't actually exist. The bodies of evidence show not only that welfare queen having kids to stay on welfare is no greater an issue than Canadian Drug Cartels. We know that drug testing welfare recipients does nothing except waste money and degrade the already down-and-out. We know that poor people were poor kids that went to poor schools. We know that poor people came from, and live in poor neighborhoods. We know that poverty is a structural, and systemic part of our economy. But the conservative dogma asserts that individual responsibility is the only cure for poverty. Just like abstinence is the only way to prevent pregnancy and STDs, Republican principle dictates that the wealthy have no responsibility to the country, only to themselves. 

Darrell Issa is a terrible person. His disingenuous diatribes are the poison that divides this country, that throws up fake problems in order to keep people from realizing that the Republican orthodoxy serves only the wealthy. The democrats might not be so much better, they are are guilty of pandering to the financial sector, and other special interests. They might not talk about it, but at least they aren't lying to our faces about it.

You really worried about money? The money we will spend on drug tests is 1/83523984563894653984658934659834659834650289364509823645th the money the government wastes on stupid crap far far worse than this. We might actually save money in the long run.

Let me ask a question. Why should people who spend their income on drugs be subsidized by the government to buy the necessities in life? Im not saying everyone on welfare is on drugs. But they won't have to worry will they?

You could say the kids will go hungry. But really we suck as a society if the most we are willing to do is make sure the children of drug addicted parents are fed. Thats nice, but the damage is being done regardless. 

Some thoughts.

&gt; We want to limit the power and reach of corporations, why does the same not apply to people on welfare?

No one is talking about drug testing the corporate officers of all corporations which receive tax breaks and other kinds of corporate welfare.  

Nothing ever happened to all of the guys who got and gave out bonuses with bailout money after the Wall Street bailout.  

We don't really limit the power and reach of corporations.  People kind of talk about it a little and then nothing happens.  However, people on welfare are told "don't buy junk food!" by people like you who don't understand that a lot of poor people live in food deserts.  Or already don't have the time or energy to take a bus 2 hours to go grocery shopping, so they buy whatever crap is available near their house.  No one is buying drugs with welfare.  In fact, when drug testing has been used to try to weed out recipients it always comes up with an astronomically low amount of people.  So low, it's not worth testing for.  And no one is using food benefits to go to the movies.  They may use a payment benefit, but those benefits are given only to the indigent elderly or people with children.  So, if someone on welfare decides that for their child's birthday they're going to go to a movie with money they're given to take care of their family - you're going to deny them that.  

Nice.  

Even poor people get to a live a little.  Just a little.

&gt; How is this relevant to Canadian politics?

It comes up from time to time.  Mike Harris proposed such a policy for Ontario in 2000, and it's been mentioned here and there since.  It's on the political radar here.

&gt; the various provincial courts of appeal have found that there is a super high threshold for drug testing -- I doubt this could be implemented for welfare recipients

In day-to-day practice, it's the human rights acts and their developed case law that prohibit broad (and in some cases, like Ontario, even narrow) drug testing.  However that's simply provincial statute, and it doesn't apply to the government anyway, only private entities like employers.

Most (all?) of the case law on the Charter and drug testing by the state applies to criminal law, mostly WRT mandatory blood samples and their admissibility as evidence in criminal trials.  There are of course, complex and multiple rights-related issues in such matters.

Welfare is not a right.  The legislature could presumably make it conditional on a clean drug test.  It's possible that a Charter equality challenge could be made, but it might not succeed.  I'd note that it's certainly discriminatory to throw addicts in prison for drug possession, but it's also quite constitutional and we do it all time.

Getting on welfare without taking a drug test. Or receiving any government assistance without taking a drug test.

"Wasting money" amounts to holding people responsible? If you think requiring welfare recipients to pass a drug test in order to receive benefits is "wasting money," perhaps this is why this country has been so fiscally inept the past few years.

Aah, you're not going to smoke - you know better. Smoking will just add another anxiety to your list, both because you'll have broken your sobriety and for fear of a drug test by the job. It sounds like you're in a good place right now with that interview coming up and a plan in place for filling your time productively. No need to get high.
------
No becuase drug tests, test for the metabolites that the drugs break down into. You would have to do some (maybe sniff alil), and then take the test to see if its oxy. I know that defeats the point, as you do not want ingest something your not sure about.
------
To your first point. Yes, I think the government can tell you what you can buy and not buy. I didn't go through the list, but the idea of not buying high-end (but not more nutritious) food is fine. If they say that you can only buy gerber baby formula, that's wrong. Drug tests? Fine with me. Not going to a strip club? Also fine with me. 

In a perfect world stress isn't a good motivating factor, but stress, and failure (or the fear of failure) are the two biggest motivating factors there are. The other is shame. People want to act like negative feelings are bad. They are a vital part of life. They are critical to the idea of change and growth. Adversity is far more useful than contentment when it comes to motivating people. Another great motivating factor is high self esteem and already being productive. So is being just a great altruistic person.

And the idea of being a 'good' motivator or 'bad' motivator is not that important. The question is motivation as a whole, which stress is a terrific motivator and actually produces results. 

To clarify: people on their own should feel stressed when they are coming close to, or are on welfare. they should feel that on their own, and they do. it's not about welfare artificially creating stress, but merely saying, "we aren't going to give you what you think you want, we are merely doing enough to put you in a situation to get yourself out." That "enough" may be different for many, but doing the bare minimum for someone creates a sense of urgency that helps people thrive. 

EDIT: 
What I could see is starting some of these tougher programs, maybe 30 days in. Drug test at the beginning of welfare for everyone, if they are positive, continue with testing every x amount of days. If they had no traces of drugs in their system, have a vetting process where we don't just waste money on drug tests for people who aren't on drugs.

I never give to the homeless downtown because I don't know what they are going to do with the money.   Or maybe I do know.. and that's why.   I think if they did some kind of permitting for them,  they should be required to take drug tests and could only get the permit if they passed it monthly.

My favorite part of Florida welfare drug testing:

&gt; Rick Scott pushed mandatory drug testing—provided, in part, by his wife’s company, Solantic⁠. Scott transferred his $62 million stake⁠ in the company to his wife only a few months before mandating drug testing for state employees and welfare recipients.

I have no problem with EBT people buying whatever food they want to make (because seafood and steak is mega nutritious). The only purchase that really makes me look askance at people with EBT cards is the people who buy cigarettes while using EBT for their food, effectively having the taxpayer finance a lethal habit they can't afford. Forget narcotic drug testing, they should test your blood for nicotine if you want to be on welfare. If you're still hooked, you don't get other people's money for your food, because while you claim not to be able to afford things, you're still flushing $30/week down the shitter killing yourself, exponentially raising your heathcare costs, slowly murdering your juvenile dependents who have to live with your smoke, and killing people standing near you. It's a serious detriment to society.

It's like trying to fix the deficit by drug testing welfare recipients. The cost for extra enforcement is never going to make up for the fare evasion.
