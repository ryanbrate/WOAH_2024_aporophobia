&gt;Your stance is a great illustration at the internal struggle and inconsistency of libertarianism

What, so I have to tow the party line or I'm an asshole?  Because that's worked out so well for the Republicans and the Democrats.  I think a bit of internal debate is healthy.

&gt;people really do want the gov to intervene a lot more than libertarianism can logically permit.

I'm not an ancap, I'm a libertarian.  There's lots of stuff we need government for, but there's also lots of room for cuts and reform.  For starters we could easily slash a couple hundred billion from defense if we weren't so intent on policing the world and killing all the muslims, we could lower prison costs by restructuring criminal justice to only hold people who are a threat to themselves or others (violent offenders), we could lower welfare costs by scrapping the current bureaucracy and replacing it with a negative income tax.  There's also stuff that while it wouldn't save any money is just the right thing to do, such as eliminating the cap on legal immigration.  Might a lot of libertarians disagree with my stance on welfare, or abortion?  Probably, but like I said that's not a crime.

As for your points about the bankruptcy, I have to admit that's just not an issue I care all that much about.  It's not my pet cause, and I'm not going to be leading the charge for it's reform or getting in the way of anyone who wants to reform it.  I don't have any problem with the concept of bankruptcy.  I was just trying to say it's a little disingenuous to label all libertarians as thinking bankruptcy is too kind or whatever /u/jakj was trying to get at.  We're not all ancaps or objectivists.  /r/Libertarian is as representative of libertarianism as /r/ShitRedditSays is representative of feminism.

This is my own speculation, but I don't think that's why, I imagine both poor and rich know that children are expensive. This doesn't account for younger people, teens to early twenties or so because they likely don't have a concept of money, whether rich or poor. 

I think it's more to do with education, stress/time, and the means to get abortions and birth control. Many poor people don't even have insurance or know where to go/what their options are. They know birth control exists, what it is, and the same for abortions, that's not what I mean, but they don't know how to go about getting or aquiring those things and their friends and family are often in the same position. Even if they could get free birth control and free abortions in their area (which I doubt they can anyway) they likely wouldn't be aware of it. With more stress and less free time they also don't have as much time to do research, and stress eats away at your time to you have to keep in mind. A rich girl on the other hand simply asks her friend or doctor.

I used to be very religious.

I used to be against all government sponsored social programs aimed at helping the poor. welfare, food stamps, SNAP, medicare/caid, section 8, etc

I used to be a firm believe of "work hard and you WILL succeed".  Poor people were poor by choice.

I used to be against mandatory available paid sick, vacation, maternal/paternal leave.

I used to be against abortion from the moment of conception.

I used to be against some forms of contraception. 

I used to be against gay marriage and thought homosexuality was morally wrong.

I hold none of those beliefs anymore.

I believe there are three natural rights: life, liberty and property. That's John Locke. Liberal Democracy was built upon those rights.

Abortion is an issue that puts two of those rights in conflict. The only morality of law should be those three rights I mentioned earlier. 

People might have personal views on this, but they're not enough for public policy/law.

There are three ways in which you could get away from this mess: by ranking the rights, by accepting a view on this issue or by moving away from the morality of this.

Ranking them would be a mess. One could argue that life comes before liberty, so it would be acceptable if one enslaved others to save their lives. That's ridiculous.

Accepting a view (abortion doesn't violate the mother's freedom/the fetus life) is problematic as well. The law would become something it should never become.

The only possible way out is by making an exception (the only I can think of) and not judging this issue by the moral/3-rights standard.

What bad happens when you legalize abortion? Well, the STD transmission rate among heterosexuals may go up, as the "cost" of unprotected sex would go down from "I may have a baby" to "I may have to make an abortion". What good happens when you legalize it? [Crime goes down](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittTheImpactOfLegalized2001.pdf). No women is killed when they attempt an insecure abortion at some clandestine clinic.

Pragmatically speaking, legalizing it is way better than prohibiting it, so it should be legalized.

That's the only issue in which I take a pragmatic and not a moral view on.

MLM groups in the US have focused on organizing poor people for self defense and solidarity in urban neighborhoods. Part of that also includes solidarity with 3rd world movements through anti-imperialist struggle here at home. So that meant resistance during the Vietnam war and continuing straight up through the current day with anti war activism. That is a significant part of MLM organizing work, but it is not everything, since we are also importantly organizing around all the critical issues people face in their daily lives. Like facing abusive police, mass imprisonment, women's rights including safe access to abortions, environmental racism, and many other issues that affect working class people's real lives on a daily basis.

I've never thought of Down Syndrome children as a burden or that they costed a lot of money to society. Maybe compared to an average Joe they're not as fun or useful, but neither are billions of people that are also below the average.

So if we draw the line on being below the average, we should be able to execute a lot of people, healthy or sick, child or adult, and I'm not really comfortable with that.

That being said, I also think parents should have the right to terminate up til some weeks of pregnancy regardless of the reason (I don't know what should be the allowed period but there are theories about this). So if it's possible to diagnose any syndrome within this period, I think it should it be up to the parents to choose for abortion just the same.

There could be some inequality though. Since rich people would be able to afford more expensive diagnoses, there would be likely to be more poor children with syndromes or healthy issues. So to compensate for that I'm in favor of free health care for everyone so everyone could be entitled to make an informed decision. But now I digress.

So no, I don't think it should be mandatory.

&gt; I veiw sex as something we are compelled to do by our biology.

Yeah, for *procreation!*  You can't just ignore the fact that the point of sex is to create kids, and then argue that we should be able to ignore those kids when they happen.  And besides, *of course* you can choose to live a life of abstinence.  Nobody *has* to have sex to survive.  We *want* sex.  And you want sex without the consequences.  That's not how life works, nor should it be.  I notice you ignored my driving analogy so I can only assume you wouldn't support a man's choice to opt out of his financial responsibilities before choosing to drive.  But I can't see much difference between the two.

&gt; the person/people who made the decision to have the child.

Yeah, exactly what I've been arguing.  The man helped make the child.  He should help pay for it.  Yes I realize you're talking about the decision not to abort and I admit that's a bit more gray - women have all the power there and that's not really fair - but still if you make a child and that child is walking this earth, you should do the right thing by that child.

&gt; you would be against adoption as well right?

Not even close to the same thing.  Adoption is a *choice*, not a compelled action by the government and to the benefit of deadbeat dads.  At the risk of getting too personal, I'm an adoptive father.  I've got multiple kids and not all of them are biologically mine.  But either sex can put a child up for adoption.  Hell if baby's mama finds a man who wants them, he can adopt the kids away from bio-dad and everything is great.  And besides, mothers are compelled to care for their children too.  An unfit mother has no problem losing their parental rights if they choose to, in fact sometimes its not even their choice.  Neither does an unfit father.  I've said all along and I maintain - a parent who is capable of caring for their kids should do so.

&gt; financial abortion

This is the stupidest thing.  Can I financially abort my car note?  Mortgage?  Can I financially abort my student loans?  Can I financially abort my taxes?  What about my power bill?  I don't want to pay those things, so why should I have to.  If I'm entitled to sex without consequences, then surely I'm entitled to a car and an education.  

And of course we're *completely* ignoring the psychological effect on the child.  I know kids who are having to cope with the fact that their biological parents didn't want them and gave them up for adoption.  That's devastating to the child.
<TRUE>

This is mostly the core of our (pro-lifer's) problem with abortion after rape.  It's not that we want rape to happen or that we even want the mother and the child to remain in proximity afterwards.  It's that we believe that the unborn child has the same human worth as every other walking born human.  

We don't believe that once the child exists the crime of the rapist should allow a killing to take place.


Here's my current thinking on this issue:

The argument isn't one of rights ("Right to Life" is a poor term.)  Rights extend from the hypothetical condition where no government exists and then set up a social contract where we agree to mutually not hurt each other.  The problem with that system is that it only works as long as the party with whom you are contracting can hurt or help you.  Historically, large scale rights are not extended to parties until either their human worth is recognized (blacks, women) or they demonstrate their abilities to hurt the body politic (Plebs, working class labor, Bolshiveks, etc...)  In both cases mentioned above with "human worth" there is also an element of their abilities to hurt the body politic (civil war and slave revolts, suffragettes.)

That the argument is being made over the "rights" of totally helpless humans, means they will never get their rights.  They may however get human dignity, then get rights.  Justice extends from the Rawlsian space, provided that we include fetuses as an option the uninterested observer might be forced into entering.

You realize that birth control is expensive without health insurance, right? And that rape and abuse is really, really common. Many people who are very poor or homeless also don't have access to the kind of safe sex education that you have.

Thank you for making a comment that actually furthers the discussion, rather than just blindly downvoting an unpopular opinion.

&gt;Weird though, can't remember the last time a Christian shot someone based on religious reasons.

[Some sources indicate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism#Christian_Identity_and_anti-abortion_killings) that religious killings carried out by Christians occurred as recently as 2009 in the USA. Of course it bears repeating that Anders Behring Breivik saw himself as acting as a "Christian Crusader", and yet his disgraceful act wasn't followed by grenade attacks on churches...

It is also arguable that some of the atrocities committed by Israel in Palestine (don't get me wrong, there is an element of self-defence involved and the Palestine authorities are by no means blameless in that conflict) were motivated by Zionist ideology.

As for the inclusion of Ganesh in the image above, here are some examples of [Hindu extremism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_terror). And finally regarding Buddhism, [here's an article from last month](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27880922).

For good measure, here's an example of [Sikh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182) terrorism as well.

Now I take the point that there is one particular aspect of a very particular Muslim ideology which is being taken up here, which is that of depiction of the Prophet, but as I said the implication goes deeper and I don't feel that it's entirely fair. I also think it's disingenuous to suggest that Christianity is somehow more "evolved". I think the main reason "we" as "the West" are more worried about Muslim terrorism is becuase it's more predominantly directed at *us* more explicitly. If it's aimed at anyone else, the media often tries to spin it as "freedom fighting". Where do you draw the line?

Personally, I don't consider bombing abortion clinics, lynching black people, ordering air strikes on civilian population centres, bombing mosques, burning down people's houses **or** shooting cartoonists to be acceptable expressions of faith. And yet only the condemnation of one of these is extended to cover the views of the entire religious group popularly associated with it.

I don't understand why people don't talk about this with their gynecologists. My self esteem would take this ridiculous plunge before I got my period, and in turn worsen effects of anxiety/depression/PTSD that I already dealt with on a day to day basis. It was a fucking nightmare. 

I already felt very insecure because of the anxiety/depression/PTSD, and some days it was worse than other days, but I was working on not projecting it on to my relationship with my current SO because I wanted it to work out, but then it would just get out of hand the couple weeks before my period. Then we found out I was having my period pretty much twice a month.

Told my GP/gyno because I didn't know what to do anymore, and she put me on once a day birth control to start out. Got mood swings worse than before for like the first month, but then it evened out and the PMS was much more mild after that. 

Since then, I've tried a different kind, and the pms is barely there. On the empty week, I'm more irritable/prone to crying/in pain. But it's SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER than having it affect disorders I was already dealing with and everything feels much more manageable and my relationship with my SO is intact still after a few years.

Adoption is great and all, but isn't an end all for some people who don't have the money for pre-natal care, and can't get off work for that sort of stuff.  While most places have free adoption drop off areas, usually in hospitals, there are still emotional and physical costs.  The emotional costs go through the roof once the birth actually occurs.  

Yeah, it would be great if everyone could give up their kids for adoption, or if all pregnancies were wanted.  But they aren't, and they can't and abortion needs to remain an option.  


And what does post-adoption wealth matter?  People who can afford to adopt usually don't need welfare or live shitty lives.   It's the biological parents of the child that end up having shitty lives and on welfare.

&gt; but the flatly incorrect, horribly sexist comments you are making here 

Where? Seriously, I have no idea what you're talking about. That is insanely rude to call me sexist with absolutely NO basis or proof or logical justification.    

A) Fact: Women are the only ones who can have abortions.  
B) Fact: The Ohio House voted for a heartbeat bill that would unconstitutionally ban abortion around 6 weeks.  
C) Fact: The Ohio House is predominantly male (74%)  
D) Fact: The co-sponsors of the heartbeat bill are even more predominantly male (88%)  
E) Fact: [Only 47 percent of Ohio's population supports the heartbeat bill, with majority opposition from "females, blacks and those 55 or older."](http://www.sapersteinassociates.com/default.asp?contentID=657)  

Edit: Did you bother to read [the actual survey](http://www.gallup.com/poll/162374/americans-abortion-views-steady-amid-gosnell-trial.aspx) from the article you cited? Maybe you're unclear on what a "pro-life" position is. Because 80% of Americans **do not** believe abortion should be illegal in all circumstances.

Everyone so far has gotten the definition wrong, so I will try to explain it more thoroughly since everyone just kind of have blown it off with "Feminists claim rape doesn't get punished", and/or that it's about rich people not being punished for rape, neither of which are necessarily accurate.

The idea of Rape Culture is the idea that there is systematic objectification of women in society, this objectification and depersonification can emerge in ways such as not recognizing women as deserving the same rights and access to human services (such as birth control access, abortion rights ((and control over their own bodies)), etc.), but also in less serious ways such as cat-calling and harassment of women.

There is also the shaming some women are faced with when they ignore or express anger or disinterest at the courting attempts of others; the other coin of that is "slut-shaming" of women who have a lot of partners or outwardly express enjoyment in physical pleasure or sex. 

All of this kind of condenses into a culture that creates a feedback loop for rapists, and that because the culture as a whole dehumanizes and objectifies women, it creates a psychological and cultural support structure for rapists. 

So essentially the theory is that a significant amount of rapes are perpetuated by people who have been trained by a sexist culture to hate and devalue the humanity of women. 

That is the ARGUMENT, now there are a lot of points that a lot of people find wrong with this definition, and there are a lot of people who don't believe in Rape Culture at all. 

You also have to make a certain amount of presumptions about culture, society, and the motivations of rapists that are difficult to prove with any amount of certainty. 

And the official statement of the largest anti-sexual violence organizations such a RAINN (RAPE, ABUSE, INCEST, NATIONAL NETWORK) are as follows:

RAINN urged the task focus to remain focused on the true cause of the problem. “In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming “rape culture” for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime,” 

So obviously there is still debate to be had on if we are or not.

Yeah, wouldn't the religious freedom bill not only allow discrimination against gays, but also discrimination against others on any religious grounds? I can imagine single mothers, girls on birth control (or anyone using contraceptives) or cohabiting unmarried couples falling under the discrimination as well. Interracial couples too, depending on the business owner's religious beliefs. 

I think a similar issue came up when Arizona passed laws that allowed police officers to stop anyone they suspect may be illegal (aka, Mexican). A lot of companies protested the law, because it would affect their Hispanic employee's ability to do business within the state.

Edit: Arizona's Stop and Identify law. It *obligates* a person to provide a valid ID that provides name, dob, address, height, weight, sex, hair color, eye color, and the owner's signature. It is also illegal to refuse to correctly identify yourself. The supporters of the law argue it's only applicable if an officer has "reasonable" suspicion you have, are, or will commit a crime, and that people minding their own business "shouldn't" have to worry. "Reasonable" suspicion can be anything, and it was used, from what I've heard, to harrass a lot of Hispanic residents. Kind of like how Stop and Frisk in New York is used to harrass a lot of blacks who are doing nothing but minding their own business.

&gt;The crash happened in 29. You were born in 36. That means you grew up in a period of time where banking was regulated (glas-steagal act), taxes were high on the rich, and the money was used to create infrastructure. There were no economic bubbles when you were growing up. The corporate tax rates when you were 20 were slightly more than DOUBLE what they are now, and that money was well spent on infrastructure

There were hardly any men under 40 in the US from 41-45. They were all away at war.

Food was rationed. Gasoline was rationed. Rubber was rationed. Nylon was non existent. Wages were low for those working to,support the war effort.

We,we're in depression from the year of my birth until the war broke out in 41.jobs were scarce. Dad was an attorney and got a job once repossessing ford automobiles until this guy chased him down,the street with a machete for taking his car.

We started ecovering after the war. 46-50 were good,years for employment. Construction was booming.

50-57 were war years again with the Korean war winding down in 54. That war has never ended. It is still officially on.

57-72 were very good years in America, except for the Vietnam war.

Our culture started falling apart in about 67. The summer of love in Sf, I was there, started off pretty good with all the patchouli oil and marijuana smoke in the air, and free love, and LSD, I could tell you some stories.
By 72 the flower children were pretty,much gone and hard,drugs overtook marijuana as the drug of choice for too many young people. Heroin ruined many lives. The advent of pornography in about 69 and abortion and single parent, no dad, families started to take hold. Social,welfare programs skyrocketed. Lbjs great society was a real drag. Ruined a lot for a lot of people.

The cost of the coverage is determined by the insurance companies and the insurance industry factors in lifestyle risks in deciding the amount to be charged.    Under the new law, they can raise premiums up to a certain percentage each year without Congressional approval and some have already begun to do so and others have indicated their intent to do so.  

After the law passed, each of the 50 states had to decide on whether or not to accept a Medicare program (government assisting the finance of medical care) change that would have subsidized premium costs for the poor that are unable to pay those high premiums.  For now, the premium subsidies for people in those states that did not accept the change (and the state taxpayer responsibilities that came with it) are being paid by a federal -- national government -- subsidy; however, there is a US Supreme Court case that will soon decide if that federal subsidy is legal.  

As I understand it, 

The new US federal tax forms for reporting income for 2014 will have question(s) on whether or not you have had insurance for the year and, if you did not have insurance in 2014, you will owe,  as a "tax" a "penalty" about $350 -- an amount that is going to be added to your tax debt. 

The personal  penalty/tax owed if you fail to have insurance for 2015 will be larger.  One report I read is that it will be about $1,500  -- and the amount is likely to increase each year thereafter.

In the US, the two majority parties -- Republican and Democrat -- have different agendas:

The Republicans tend to support policies that help big business and the very rich, without regard to the overall adverse effect on the nation as a nation; however, 

the Democrats tend to support policies that help the employee class and the poor, but also, all too often, without regard to the overall adverse effect on the nation as a nation.

Then there is the "culture" war.

The Democrats embraced equality with the civil rights laws and earned minority loyalty; however, they are now, all to often, just  "eat up" with political correctness, which in the past has help ensure that most minority voters supported Democrats, but now often also serves as an impediment to their recognizing and addressing some very real culturally based problems for fear of offense.  

Since beginning w/the Reagan era, the Republicans have been  "eat up" with religion.  In more recent years they've been providing some tangible legal rewards to the religious zealots for going to the polls in a religious stupor and voting Republican, usually contrary to their own economic best interest.  This usually involves enacting laws that are anti equality and anti personal freedom -- anti women's rights, especially anti-abortion and anti-contraception, and generally against the individual liberty of anyone and everyone that would make any personal or lifestyle choice that is not in accord with the Republican chosen flavor of religious zealotry -- the Christian flavor of zealotry that votes Republicans into office.  

The US political system has become a battle of cultures and pure class warfare of the base kind that has existed since before rich English kings waged war -- killed -- impoverished peasants hunting in the king's forests to feed their hungry families.  

From what I've read, less than ten percent of the richest people own or control over ninety percent of the wealth (supposedly true in most nations) and, unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be enough wealth because the greed of the greediest of the wealthiest of the investor class is, seemingly, boundless -- yet they accuse those without wealth that seek to  better their own economic situation of waging the very class warfare the rich have been and are still waging with renewed vigor via their inve$tment in -- financing of -- the US political process and their inve$tment in lobbying, etc., in order to control government to have it service the wants and needs of the rich.

I've always been registered as an Independent and voted for the individual person on the ballot without regard to political party.  That is changing with the Republican embrace of religious zealotry.
To Republicans, freedom now seems to only apply to the money of those with much of it -- the unregulated pursuit of it and the untaxed hoarding of it.  Even their support for gun freedom seems to be about gun company profits.  Their support for religious freedom is more support for freedom FOR their favored flavor of religious zealotry than freedom of religion -- which must include freedom from religion.  The Republican party has become the party of the plutocrats that rejects individual liberty and equal right under law with regard to some of the most personal and important and consequential decisions any person can make. 

What passes for leadership within the Republican party more and more and all too often rejects the right of women to make their own decisions and seeks to prohibit or impede or penalize women for making any decision that is contrary to the dogma of their favorite flavor of religious zealotry -- the ones that put the party of the minority rich in public offices across the nation.

I'm not gay -- not LGBT at all -- but cannot support the Republican  cultural view that seeks to have government discriminate against those in the LGBT community as if they are less than human and should, therefore, somehow have less equality of rights.

This is probably my biggest issue with complete prohibiton of abortion. 55 million abortions have occured in the US since Roe v Wade. 

Now consider the incredible problems that already exist within the social secuity, education, and criminal justice systems in the US. Now add 55 million people, most of whom will come from disadvantaged backgrounds.

&gt;Honestly, I have yet to see anyone :"gang up" on a bunch of homosexuals.

Then you are totally oblivious to reality.   The section pasted below is 400% longer than what would even fit here.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_violence_against_LGBT_people_in_the_United_States

1970–1979

    March 1970 – Howard Efland, a gay man who had checked into the Dover Hotel, under the pseudonym J. McCann, was beaten to death by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department.[7]
    June 24, 1973 – An arsonist burned the Upstairs Lounge in New Orleans, a gay bar, killing 32 people.[8]
    June 21, 1977 – Robert Hillsborough was stabbed to death in San Francisco by a man shouting "faggot".[9]
    July 5, 1978 – A gang of youths armed with baseball bats and tree branches assaulted several men in an area of Central Park in New York City known to be frequented by homosexuals. The victims were assaulted at random, but the assailants later confessed that they had deliberately set out to the park to attack homosexuals. One of those injured was former figure skater Dick Button, who was assaulted while watching a fireworks display in the park.[10][11]
    November 27, 1978 – Openly gay San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk, along with Mayor George Moscone, was assassinated by political rival Dan White at San Francisco City Hall. Outrage over the assassinations and the short sentence given to White (seven years) prompted the White Night riots.[12]
    January 1979 – Tennessee Williams was beaten by five teenage boys in Key West. He escaped serious injury. The episode was part of a spate of anti-gay violence inspired by an anti-gay newspaper ad run by a local Baptist minister.[13]
    June 5, 1979 – Terry Knudsen was beaten to death by three men in Loring Park in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[14]
    September 7, 1979 – Robert Allen Taylor was stabbed to death near Loring Park in Minneapolis. A local reporter interviewed the murderer from jail and was told, "I don't like gays. Okay?"[14]
    October 7, 1979 – 17-year-old Steven Charles of Newark was beaten to death in New York City by Robert DeLicio, Costabile "Gus" Farace, Farace's cousin Mark Granato, and David Spoto. They also beat Charles' friend, 16-year-old Thomas Moore of Brooklyn. Moore was critically injured but managed to get help at a nearby residence. Moore identified the four men via a lineup four days after the incident. Farace, the leader of the attack, pled guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was paroled after eight years, in 1988. He, himself was murdered on November 17, 1989.[15]

1980–1989

    1984 – Charlie Howard was drowned in Bangor, Maine for being "flamboyantly gay".[16]
    May 13, 1988 – Rebecca Wight was killed when she and her partner, Claudia Brenner, were shot by Stephen Roy Carr while hiking and camping along the Appalachian Trail. Carr later claimed that he became enraged by the couple's lesbianism when he saw them having homosexual relations.[17]
    May 15, 1988 - Tommy Lee Trimble and John Lloyd Griffin, two gay men, were harassed and later shot by Richard Lee Bednarski in Dallas, Texas. Bednarski is later convicted of the two murders but is sentenced to 30 years rather than life in prison. The judge who issued the sentence, Jack Hampton, said later that he did so because the victims were homosexuals who wouldn't have been killed if they "hadn't been cruising the streets" for men. Hampton's comments cause controversy and he is later censured for his remarks. He loses a judicial re-election in 1992.[18][19]

1990–1999

    1990 – James Zappalorti, a gay Vietnam veteran, was stabbed to death.[20]

All ten of the attackers were eventually convicted, with sentences ranging from a probation and fine for the respective hospitalization and funeral bills to the 45-year imprisonment of Jon Buice, who confessed to inflicting the fatal stab wound.[22]
    October 27, 1992 – U.S. Navy Petty Officer Allen Schindler was murdered by a shipmate who stomped him to death in a public restroom in Japan.[23] Schindler had complained repeatedly about anti-gay harassment aboard ship.[23] The case became synonymous with the gays in the military debate that had been brewing in the United States culminating in the "Don't ask, don't tell" bill.[24]
    1993 – Brandon Teena, a trans man, was raped and later killed when his birth gender was revealed by police to male friends of his.[25] The events leading to Teena's death were depicted in the movie Boys Don't Cry.[26]
    March 9, 1995 – Scott Amedure was murdered after revealing his attraction to his friend Jonathan Schmitz on a The Jenny Jones Show episode about secret crushes. Schmitz purchased a shotgun to kill Amedure and did so after Amedure implied he still was attracted to him; Schmitz then turned himself in to police.[27][28]
    November 20, 1995 – Chanelle Pickett, 23, an African American trans woman, died at the home of William C. Palmer after a fight that ensued after Palmer discovered that she was transgender and he demanded she leave his home.

    February 21, 1997 – The Otherside Lounge, a lesbian nightclub in Atlanta, was bombed by Eric Robert Rudolph, the "Olympic Park Bomber;" five bar patrons were injured. In a statement released after he was sentenced to five consecutive life terms for his several bombings, Rudolph called homosexuality an "aberrant lifestyle".
    October 7, 1998 – Matthew Shepard, a gay student, in Laramie, Wyoming was tortured, beaten severely, tied to a fence, and abandoned; he was found 18 hours after the attack and succumbed to his injuries less than a week later, on October 12. His attackers, Russell Arthur Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, are both serving two consecutive life sentences in prison.[32]
    February 19, 1999 – Billy Jack Gaither, a 39-year-old gay man, was brutally beaten to death in Rockford, Alabama. His attackers, Steve Mullins and Charles Monroe Butler, were found guilty of murder and were both sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.[33]

Tyler Williams was sentenced to a minimum of 33 years in prison, to be served after his completion of a 21-year sentence for firebombing synagogues and an abortion clinic.[34] Benjamin Williams claimed that by killing the couple he was "obeying the laws of the Creator".[35] He committed suicide in 2003 while awaiting trial. Their former pastor described the brothers as "zealous in their faith" but "far from kooks".[36]
    July 6, 1999 – U.S. Army Pfc. Barry Winchell was murdered in Fort Campbell, Kentucky by fellow soldier Calvin Glover. Winchell was beaten to death with a baseball bat after rumors spread on base of his relationship with transgendered author Calpernia Addams.

    September 1999 – Steen Fenrich was murdered, apparently by his stepfather, John D. Fenrich, in Queens, New York. His dismembered remains were found in March 2000, with the phrase "gay nigger number one" scrawled on his skull along with his social security number. His stepfather fled from police while being interviewed, then committed suicide.[38]
    October 15, 1999 – Sissy "Charles" Bolden was found shot to death in Savannah, Georgia. Police arrested Charles E. Wilkins, Jr., in July 2003; he admitted the killing, and was charged in two other homicides, according to the Savannah Police Department.

2000–2009

On April 29, 2009, The U.S. House of Representatives voted to extend federal law to classify as "hate crimes" attacks based on a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity (as well as mental or physical disability).[39] The U.S Senate passed the bill on October 22, 2009.[40] The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law by President Barack Obama on October 28, 2009.[41]

I was a senior in high school.  I dated this guy who kinda smelled like cauliflower who had problems with depression, but swore up and down that God was enough for him to manage it (guys, it's not, please go get help if you're dealing with depression).

He tried to get me to go all creepy Christian (conveniently using religion to control people, you know, that type).  I wasn't so interested, but I liked being liked.

For awhile, I kinda got off on the drama when he'd call me every day and I'd try to talk him down from offing himself.  But eventually, it really got old and tiring.

But then he hit me with this one day after we were talking about what age we'd feel comfortable having sex:

"Well, we won't need birth control because I'll just get you pregnant and if you're pregnant, you won't need birth control."

I took one look at the fact that his mom was in her 40's and pregnant and had a baby and like five kids and realized he wasn't even joking.  He honestly believed this.

SO I NOPED THE FUCK OUT.

Thank goodness.  His family ended up homeless because his dad refused to let his wife work at all and they had to move in with this weird extremely religious missionary group in Texas.

He tried to contact me a couple of times and went on about how he'd changed, but I just shot him down (politely) and blocked him.

I personally think I made the right decision.

You're wrong, because Christians are starting to support us because they're no longer being beat by their parents into hating us, no longer chased out of town by their church and then tarred and feathered for supporting us.  They no longer even have to worry about break-ins anymore, if we're talking about white people, and I assume you are, since you are claiming they support gay rights.  They don't even have to worry about dirty drinking water anymore, or earthquakes, all white people homes are so modern and safe they're even safe from forces of nature.  Infinite peace and safety breeds in them an infinite fear, so that even a wooden splinter in their finger is life-threatening, and they wouldn't dare offend a homosexual because to offend a homosexual is too scary.  Homophobia among western white people arises mostly from 60+ conservatives, who still remember being beat as punishment for being fair to other people, and among teenagers, who are still in PTSD while they're in highschool and determined to carry that highschool culture with them everywhere to prove their loyalty.

You're wrong, because I took certain creative licenses with my words, when we're posting in a thread about supporting the creation of hate speech laws/not creating hate speech laws.  I propose that we create as many hate speech laws as possible, my position should be clear from my personality, you support the creation of none.

You're wrong, because in Baltimore, black people maimed riot police, robbed gas stations, set whole blocks on fire, beat random white people, all because cops murdered one innocent black man who's only crimes were being fast on his feet and being paranoid.  In response to black people maimed, stealing, burning and beating, those cops will face justice.  They wouldn't have otherwise.  It was the same way with Rodney King, and other riots.  If every single LGBT person took to the street and beat the nearest straight person in response to a trans kid who commited suicide in the news, the teachers, principal, students, parents, preacher, judges and juries that supported that kid killing herself would all face jail time.

You're wrong, because I love myself, so much.  You can't imagine how much.  However high you've been, or however drunk, or however enlightened you've felt after reading your bible, your high doesn't amount to anything compared to the feeling I get when I realize I exist.

You're wrong, because since the earliest days of the Pride Parades, police have been busting them.  Police still bust them in some cities in the U.S.  You see, straight people don't think that Pride Parades deserve freedom of speech.  It wasn't the bravery of the Freedom of Speech that made those parades possible.  It was the bravery of the LGBT people who march in them.

You're wrong, because most Christians still don't support gay rights.  Most conservatives still only support conservative parties because of gay marriage and abortion, and abortion is a lost battle already, their last great hope is gay marriage.  Conservatives still have enough support that the battles are always close, in fact in some first world countries they still win once in a while.  I'm not concerned with what straight people SAY they believe in surveys, where they're so afraid they won't even tell the truth anonymously, I'm concerned with what they DO, where they try to vote against my freedom.

You're wrong, because you're not trying to be right.

&gt;I imagine it would be against the law to post a giant banner featuring someone's bloody removed cancerous tumour or a severed gangrenous limb

No it's not. In fact, do you buy cigarettes? They're required by law to include labels that sometimes include bloody cancerous tumors.

&gt;so why the hell are these banners and pamphlets allowed?

Because it's not *pleasant speech that everyone approves of* that needs legal protection.

&gt;I would like to contact someone in government

/sigh

We're a representative democracy. Contact your local representative. That's how it works.

&gt;this isn't about censoring anyone's views or opinions.

You want the *government* to stop certain people from *saying* a certain thing in a certain way in public. That is exactly what censoring opinions is. You don't want to be considered someone who advocates for censorship, but you also want certain people to be prevented from "saying" things you find unpleasant.

&gt;traumatizing

&gt;miscarriages

&gt;forced to view

You have my deepest sympathies for your trauma and loss. But part of our society's ability to permit people to say what they think involves encountering expression we disagree with or find unpleasant.

finally,

&gt;gory images being forced on me

&gt;threatening, insulting language

&gt;meant to be upsetting

I don't think you quite grasp what "forced" means. "Forced" would be if you were required by the government to attend education seminars and write documents confirming your understanding- grade school students are, to an extent, "forced" to attend school (though there are alternatives). You are presented with expression on your doorstep/in your mailbox that you find deeply unsavoury. I sympathize; I also receive unsavoury communications outside my front door and at work, including neo-nazi anti-Chinese racism and graphic images of the torture and organ harvesting of Falun Gong prisoners.

But I am not required to engage with these protesters or images, and I do not have the right to not encounter upsetting things. The inside of my house is free of neo-nazi propaganda and images of bloody organs. I also see the graphic images of aborted fetuses and it squicks me the fuck out. But being squicked out by something does not mean I can demand the government stop people from showing it to me.

I am sure you are a good person, but I think you misunderstand how government and free speech work in Canada. Anti-abortion protesters may be tactically unsound in their approach, offensive, and pushy, but if we as a society decide they (or any other group- homosexuals, Falun Gong, neo-nazis, any out-group you care to name) are not allowed to *speak*, they do not throw up their hands and stop trying to engage society; they are simply forced to use illegal rather than legal means, whether they feel driven to speak illegally or pursue other types of activism.

We are not, as a society, dealing with easily silenced outliers whose essential perspective is identical to ours but have a bad habit of *speaking* in ways we disagree with. We are dealing with large portions of our fellow citizens who believe deeply in things we definitely disagree with but who are following their conscience. If we use the power of government to silence them, we are morally authorizing the government to silence us as well.

We legally protect neo-nazi marches, not because we *agree* with them, but because the alternative is to live in a society where people are afraid to speak. It's not a good idea to be "against public display" for any lesser reason. 40 years ago Canada would have banned homosexual rights marches on the same basis. "But this squicks me out" is not a good argument.

It's important to note that this in no way debunks men's rights.  Men and boys still have serious issues that are being ignored by the mainstream, and often being accelerated by feminists (e.g. genital cutting).

That said:

1. They accept the fact that men kill themselves far more often than women, and then BLAME the victims for being trained by society (of which females are a slight majority) to be good at this.  If you value life and humanity, it's irrelevant what other crimes some suicides also committed.  We try to improve things, after bad things happen.  And of course it profoundly defames all the other suicides (teen transboys and gay boys for example) to lump them in with mass murderers just to score political points with feminists.

2. It's not merely the oldest, but rather those nearest death (regardless of age) who consume health resources the most.  We all die.  Men should be getting about half the health care.  Further, women have significant expenses such as 20 methods of birth control, and pregnancy issues, that men do not have.   So of course insurers want to recover their costs.  I don't believe in sex segregated bathrooms, sports, or insurance.  But feminists do.  Go figure.

3. Regardless of the handful of individuals in charge (who may all be men, but who recently and increasingly have been women), the fact remains that the people who PUT THEM THERE are mostly women voters.  Democracies would not be involved in war if women didn't want it to happen.  And I wonder if Harvard Medical School is familiar with the tactics of the Islamic State in the several countries (perhaps even 13 by now) it is active in.  Girls get raped, but live.  Boys are simply slaughtered.

4. This is not worthy of response.  But I will note that at least some of the safety compliance issues are due to the fact that the job is not actually feasible (for cost or time) if the rules are complied with.  Simply watching the work on YouTube will show you that.

5. Notice how quickly they ignore the victims to focus on the aggressors (a form of sexist victim-blaming) when it is irrelevant to answering the question "Is this a problem?"   Disgusting, but typically feminist.

6. "because both parents usually understand that it is in the best interests of their children" Citation needed, sweetie.  Citation needed.  I suspect social expectation has a lot to do with it.

7. I do not have the stats before me, but I know this to be false, and I leave it to others.  However, the issue of Jury Bias remains completely unaddressed here.  We need to be looking solely at jury trials, across a wide range of criminal and civil cases.  They didn't even try, because they know they can't win this argument.

8.  Again, they didn't even try.  They'd need to look at judge-decided cases, and at fines and sentences handed out to men and women, in a variety of cases.  Murder alone doesn't explain it.  Consider baby dumping.  No man there.

9. Wait a minute.  A few thousand dollars difference in net worth, which is unrelated to income, is supposed to explain a 50% difference in ordered payments?  Ridiculous.  And why bring race into it?  But if you must, how many black women are shot in the back by an officer for fearing imprisonment for failing to pay child support?

10. I've seen studies by my own government that confirm that, yes, men are most often the victims of domestic violence (even though women are more likely to end up dead from it...).  And again, they try to victim-blame, by saying that gay partner violence is higher than straight female-on-male violence.  Who cares?  Males are victims of violence, regardless of who is doing it.  But women ARE doing a lot of it.

11. I love how many paragraphs they take to explain away how a mother can beat two of her school-age kids and lock their bodies in the freezer.  If only we had just paid her off, none of this would have happened.  

12. I have no opinion on this.  It's irrelevant in a gender-rights context.  If we want to talk about how to improve the economic system (which is shockingly near collapse as we robotize everyone out of work) then we can do that elsewhere.

See my comment below. "Misuse" was a bad choice of terminology. It is more to say that certain uses of abortion can be reflections of social issues in need of fixing. It is not to condemn the use of abortion in any case, as it is solely the choice of a pregnant person to remove a fetus from their body regardless of reason. It's not an issue of validity of reason. Reason is not relevant when it comes to rights. That was my whole point with the wealthy father example.

I can guarantee both of those people vote the same way. Old people are overwhelmingly conservative. And since most people care more about hot-button issues like gay marriage and abortion instead of real economic issues, conservatives tend to vote for things like gutting welfare and deregulation. Obviously against their own interest. 

Also most redditors will have grown up in a somewhat middle class environment to parents who had an easy life. So the current disaster that is finding a real job for young people isn't recognized by their parents. These parents see it as laziness because of how they had it when they were a young adult. And then they shit on their kids and make some of them homeless because they can't stand the idea of living with them longer than is legally requires.

&gt;It was Decriminalised in 1988, which is a different thing (and better, IMHO).

You just contradicted yourself.  When something is decriminalized, it is still illegal, it just isn't a criminal offense.  That means that violating that law does not result in a criminal record or criminal penalties which include prison sentences.  For example driving over the speed limit or jay walking are both illegal, but neither of them are criminal offenses.

Simply put, you can not legalize something, and then after it is legal you decriminalize it as well.  If something is legalized, it is also decriminalized by definition.  So in this case you claim that abortions were legalized in 1968, and then decriminalized in 1988, indicating that perhaps you are unfamiliar with both the terms as well as the legal history regarding abortion in Canada.

At any rate; in 1988 the Supreme Court of Canada found that the 1968 law was unconstitutional and struck it down, case closed.  Any reasonable, level headed person can see how absurd it would be if the Supreme Court struck down a law that legalized abortion, only to decriminalize abortion.  But of course that's not what happened in reality, what happened in reality was that the the 1968 law still criminalized abortions except in cases where a medical panel of Doctors found that the pregnancy presented a danger to the physical well being of the mother, and the Supreme Court ruled that such a requirement violated a woman's right to privacy.

I suggest you do some reading on this issue, as your claim that hospitals had a rubber stamp policy regarding abortions once again shows incredible ignorance on the issue.  It is a matter of historical record that only 1/3rd of hospitals in Canada even bothered to perform abortions, with the hospitals that did provide such access mostly being those which neighbored predominantly upper-middle to upper class families.

&gt; What if I told you that the reason the birth control program got cut was because we don't pay law makers enough?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The only people who can afford to do the job are those who are independently wealthy. Those who are independently wealthy are much less likely to fund programs that benefit those in lower incomes.

It only seemed to be Republicans that had a problem with the program. The ones in Congress get paid lots more and dont seem any more rational.

&gt;So the question is: do you hate PP more than you like poor women getting cancer screenings?  Cuz without PP a lot of women will be going without.

Because there are better ways to screen women for Cancer than supporting the racist organization that is planned parenthood. It was founded by a women named Margaret Sanger who was a proponent of Eugenics in particular trying to eliminate the black population in the US  by providing them with access to birth control. In a private letter to a colleague talking about "project negro" which would open clinics in black neighborhoods  she said "we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population ".  If that was her goal she would be proud of planned parenthood who since 1973 has aborted a estimated 13,000,000 black babies. I don't know about you but I don't want my tax dollars funding a organization like this. Do yourself a favor and educate yourself about this vile women http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger

I sue because I can. I destroy because I can.

But I cannot do much because of our political finance situation. I do NOT have the power.  The electorate is distracted by bullshit issues like abortion, gay marriage and other social issues. frankly, the Republicans are the most to blame for distraction issues. 

But Hillary? Please.

Tell me, please. 

So, before you berate me with your standards of political action - whatever they are, I ask what can I do? I vote. I voted against the teaparty guy in my state - Purdue - and he still got elected because the drooling, Fox News watching, political talk radio listening morons voted for him.

The real problem is the restrictions on freedom that such a ruling would creation. We've already seen this with civil rights commissions like Colorado. 

* Refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding, get sued into bankruptcy, refused to make a cake quoting Leviticus, court says you can refuse per personal beliefs 

* Refuse to print a banner for a gay group, sued for discrimination, refuse to make a banner for a conservative group, that's OK, you have the right to your opinion 

* Traditional religious school declines enrollment to children of homosexuals so they can teach traditional religious views without a kid running home to Mommy and Mommy crying, the school gets death threats to burn down the school

* The traditional marriage view gets silenced, in the public forum and private, now with backing of the law. It is similar to how criticism of affirmative action that leads to blacks put in schools for which they are not academically prepared is considered "diversity", but no one cares that they flunk out disproportionately. AKA, saying kids should go to state university and graduate instead of flunking out of Ivy League is more racist than giving them 200 points on the test and admitting them. 

* The creation of a protected LBGTA class means you can't decline a man in a dress from applying for a woman's only job, unless it is something like working in the warehouse where birth control pills are stored. Hence a guy in a dress can go into a woman's only club or gym and you can't refuse because he's protected. 

* The federal government has already argued in front of the Supreme Court that religious groups that refuse to perform gay marriage and don't change doctrine could lose tax exempt status. Those that meet a government approved checklist of beliefs get to keep tax exempt status. So now you have a pure violation of the First Amendment, the state intruding on religious organizations. 

* A woman who puts her kid up for adoption to a married opposite sex couple could have it end up with a household with two moms, the opposite of her intent. Massachusetts if not other states as well had adoption agencies shut down rather than place children with gays. And no, they don't actually do as well with same sex couples as married hetero couples; the prior studies were biased due to self-selection, AKA, the glowing perfect poster families. 

* Counseling for same sex attraction after sexual molestation essentially becomes illegal. 

* Counseling for a boy who decides he's a girl becomes illegal, except to say "let's get hormones and surgery". Yet 0-80% of kids who associate with the opposite gender self-rectify without therapy. 

Source: Transgender Surgery Isn't the Solution, Wall Street Journal 
http://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-mchugh-transgender-surgery-isnt-the-solution-1402615120


* Feminist groups may lose the ability to say cis-women only, because LBGTA protection includes guys in dresses. 

Summary 

A ruling in favor of legally protected gay marriage leads to viewpoint discrimination by the government and legal discrimination against contrary groups. And that is immoral.

For me, the issue is that a prohibition on abortion leads to worse results than its legalization.

I have several friends who have had abortions and it was never a choice that they made lightly.  It is a terrible decision to have to make, but it is *their* decision.

The people who can afford it will send their children to places that allow the procedure.  A great example is the relatively conservative country of Chile whose wealthy often did just that.  The poor who live in areas with prohibitions against abortion often undergo dangerous "back-alley" abortions which have a high risk of serious injury or death.  The rate of abortions does fall a little when it is outlawed, but it doesn't outweigh the effects of the unlicensed procedures. 

Sometimes it feels as if most of the people in this country, not just the conservatives, have forgotten why we legalized it in the first place.

I want to stress that I am not demeaning your personal decisions.  I do, however, want you to consider that other people draw the lines in different places (and maybe you already do).  Because the moral waters are so muddy for most of society, we should allow people some latitude to make the choice for themselves.  That is a truly "small government" position.

This was excellently written--thank you.

&gt;This attitude is usually adopted by people who have never actually been in this position

And this is why abortion is an excellent example of a situation where there is a huge disconnect between the lawmakers and the people actually affected by the law. Yeah old rich white dude whose not getting any--of *course* you don't understand why a young, disadvantaged and single woman might not be too keen on supporting a second fucking human being for around two decades just because of a shitty night the other night.

You can take birth control to prevent your period, but it's not exactly advised (normal birth control has 7 days of placebos so that you can menstruate), that, and it would be difficult to adhere to a strict medication schedule while homeless.

Teenage pregnancy rates have fallen drastically due to better sex education, wide availability of birth control and access to abortion. Pregnancy is something to be aware of and careful to avoid, but sex is not something that you should avoid until you're ready to procreate. And abstinence only education is *more* likely to end with pregnancy.

&gt;But look at the teen preg rates amongst the dumbfuck / poor classes of society and suddenly it starts making sense.

*I'm* not the one who comes across as "out of touch with the lower class" here.

&gt; we have more people then we can adequately feed.

No, we don't.  This isn't even controversial.   

"People keep breeding, making us more food poor."

It's counter-intuitive but you have it backwards.  Poor people breed more because they are poor.   Why?  Because they rely on children to augment their incomes, and because many poor people do not have access to birth control or are otherwise restricted from birth control by eg the Catholic Church.    

Again, this isn't really controversial.  There is a ton of scientific data on this.  It has nothing to do with "comfort levels."

&gt; But at one point the Constitution said that a black person's vote was worth 3/5ths of a white persons.

No, the 13th amendment counted slaves as 3/5 a person when it came to that district's representation in Congress. Black people *still* were not allowed to vote. If you were a congressman and your district had only 1 person, that person was a slave owner, and that person owned exactly 5 slaves, then the 13th amendment meant your district represented 4 people (1 slave owner plus 3/5's of his 5 slaves). 

You think reality and legal definitions should be sqaured with contemporary popular opinion of said laws? I can already tell we're going to have to "agree to disagree" on this. Public opinion did nothing to stop teh 18th amendment from banning alcohol. It did, however, cause enough backlash that they abolished it. That's the point of having a constitution. It's a living document. We can change it. That's what it means.

The point of the constitution is not to adhere whole-heartedly to a piece of paper. It is to maintain a basic set of human principles that we as a people agree upon. We are not perfect. No one has ever been perfect. That's why the 13th amendment and 18th amendment are *long gone*. You cannot imply that simply defining what those laws mean at the time they were valid as "being on the wrong side of history."

I live in a southern state that has not allowed gay marriage. It's not explicitly covered as a protected right by the constitution and there are no federal laws on the matter. Therefore, my state does not allow it. Am I on the wrong side of history for simply stating a verifiable and irrefutable fact of law? Since when does accurately portraying reality count as being "on the wrong side of history?" You have to leave that thinking at the door, because you're dangerously close to "thinking with your heart" on things.

&gt; it's only a matter of time before the supreme court will rule it unconstitutional to deny people their civil rights based on their sexual orientation.

I agree, and I will be happy to see that day. For one, it's not a matter of "feelings" for me. It's a simple, logical conclusion. I can marry my wife whom I love and have started a family with. Why can't a gay person have the same thing? (My actual legal preference on this matter is to not have a government that can dictate whom can marry whom. The constitution doesn't protect *straight* marriage either!). For second, I can't wait for yet another bullshit hot-button, boilerplate, divide-and-conquer social issue to be dead and gone forever. I don't pick my leaders based on who thinks abortion is murder and who thinks it's a "woman's right." We have actual problems in the world and quite frankly I don't give a flying fuck who is worried about whomever else is going to pay for somebody's abortion.

&gt; To say that states should have the right to decide on this issue is unfortunately political suicide on a national stage in 2015. Cruz is unelectable based on that single issue - and for exactly this reason, he's going to get hammered over and over on it by partisan media with these BS "gotcha" questions.

You have a point here beyond what you know. I mean, he's campaigning on this issue the *exact same way* Barack Obama and Hillary did in 2008. And now look. Suddenly he's "on the wrong side of history."

He's also so far into the pocket of big business and the rich it isn't even funny. He wants a 17% flat income tax. That means a 50% tax cut for the rich and a tax increase for anyone below the upper middle class. Furthermore, he wants to slash the tax on corporations and completely eliminate the capital gains tax. Meaning he wants to raise taxes on the poor so that the Koch brothers don't have to pay taxes on their investments. To make matters worse, he himself has admitted that his plan would increase the federal deficit by 700 billion dollars a year. Add that to his opposition to gay marriage and abortion rights and you have a radical candidate who is thankfully unelectable for either party. He pretends to oppose the NSA to try to win support from less informed younger voters and reddit is lapping it right up. Rand Paul is quite frankly even worse for the country than even Ted Cruz would be.

Here's the deal. Capitalism works when it is regulated properly. Today, it is not.

If you work in retail or fast food, it's effectively like being a modern day surf. You do the grunt work, you have the most expectations put on you, you control how much money the company takes home by upselling products and services, yet at the same time, when you're being told that the company goal is to "Make $10,000 a day" and it's written as "your goal" to personalize it to you, yet you only see 7, 8, 9 dollars an hour, and the company raises prices, and then somebody in upper management asks you why we raised prices, and somebody hypothetically says, "so they can pay their employees more" and upper management retorts back, "no, it's so we can keep our jobs and get the shareholders their money", you really understand that capitalism is a system that can be abused to hell.

Too much of anything is bad, and right now, we have a bad system in place. Are you aware of what the ratio of CEO pay (which mostly are in stocks, so they claim that they "didn't take home a lot of money") to minimum wage is? You should google it. I'll let you do the legwork, that way you can form your own opinion on it. 

Another thing that complicates things, and I think SJW's can't separate, is corporations making money and their CEO's making money. CEO pay is fucking insane here in the USA. And then it gets combined with how the rich are taxed. Currently there is a great debate going on with regards to raising taxes on the rich. You should check that out also, and do some deep digging. 

And quite honestly, there comes a point where it's disgusting of how vapid people are to assume that all poor people are lazy, or that all poor people are stupid liberals who whine and complain. People vote against their own interests because of one party issues, which is the great abortion thing. It's how the republicans keep their base. Get the religious crazy people in there, put forth a bazillion anti-abortion measures, rile up the crazy religious people, and then pass a bunch of shitty laws that lower taxes on the rich and create loose regulation laws. 

Anyway, this is just a rant. I am an anti-corporatist and capitalism at it's current point in time is horrible. 

When I'm at work and I have a group of telling me how nice my body is, and I cannot tell them not to do that without repercussions (if the store gets a bad survey), I'll get punished. So I can't say anything to even mitigate the conversation, and it gets even more awkward when your managers can't ban them from the store because the corporation would lose their shit if we received a bad survey. They don't care about the workers, they really don't, and if you work for them and you're not rich, mentally sound, or healthy enough to work two jobs, tough shit. 

You have to be able to separate what you can tell are somebody's personal feelings, the reality of a situation, and how that reality is affecting somebody's personal lives. 

It's to the point now where people are payed horribly, they're upset, they can't pay their bills, they can't stand up for themselves at work because the reality is that the people in the company will try to retaliate, even though the law says you can't (seriously, it happens all the time). However, if you're already well off, don't care, or you're just really lacking in empathy, you're not going to really be affected by it or even notice that it exists. 

So if somebody who is well off is telling you that the system is fine, and somebody who is not well off is telling you the system is broken, look into their claims, find out why they think the system is well off, or not, and then come up with an answer for yourself. Critical thinking.

And to your first question, think about it, it's new years; you walk into a store, and there's new years merchandise EVERYWHERE, and the stuff that isn't sold is going to be thrown away. It's there for every holiday. Also, where I worked, we had a "school/kid friendly" soundtrack that we HAD to play and we were promoting a horrible band, all the songs were about men crying about women, putting them on a golden platform, or having sex/getting drunk. The women's songs were ALL about shopping. It played on a loop, very loud, because it apparently wasn't loud enough for corporate, and there were about 20-25 songs, and it played for FIVE months. 

I literally wanted to fucking blow my brains out every single time I was in the store. I kept waking up with music in my head, literally, wake up, it was a goddman record in my mind.

Anyway, I went off track.

tl;dr this is dumb, whatever, blah

Well, never making the teenager homeless would be #1. I think abortion and adoption are the best choices here, but obviously no one should be forced to do either of these things. 

The parent of the teen needs to help them learn how to take responsibility. Not allowing them to end up homeless or in a bad situation due to the pregnancy should be their 1st responsibility. I think they are obligated to provide housing for their kid, and if that means for the baby too, then so be it. That doesn't mean the parent takes over child care, but most teenagers can't even legally rent an apartment, let alone afford to do so. But they should be pushing the kid to work at least part time to get an early move on for a career, so they can be prepared to be as independent as possible at 18 (keep in mind that many 18-year-olds receive financial support from their parents)

I don't think there is any situation where kicking the kid out of the house is the solution. The way it is dealt with is going to vary depending on the kid, particularly their level of independence and age. But making your child homeless while they have an infant to deal with is 100% not OK.

Anticipating the birth of my second child.

You would think I would have grown the fuck up with my first, but no. I was nineteen when I had him, was the stay at home mom, and this was while my marriage was falling apart and my ex decided to start fucking other women. I left and three days later his side bitch started living with him. After leaving I lived with my mother, then with a friend, a relative, another friend, and all during that time I could not find employment. I sent my son to his father's at one point so he would be spared being homeless. (Our county has one women's shelter and you have to be abused to stay there.) After a year of him living with his father I was able to get my son back while I was still searching for work at a friends home.

CPS got involved, removed us from her home, and put us back in my mother's home saying that they would enlist us in a program to help. (They did no such thing.) After almost a year I finally got a job. I still have that job. I met my current boyfriend and after a few months we learned I was pregnant. I was on birth control at the time, but apparently fucked that up somewhere. 

Next month I will have been employed for a year and I'm still at my mother's where I rent the upstairs portion of her house. (She doesn't live here, that's a whole different story.) My entire pregnancy I have walked a mile a day between work and home with a few rides along the way. My daughter is due on the 30th of this month and just recently my mother told me she was proud of me. She said I could have quit my job, but that never crossed my mind. A mile is nothing. Nine to ten hour shifts are nothing. If I quit my job I would have nothing again.

I think somewhere in my mind is a well repeated mantra that where I was with my son will never happen again because it simply can't. I can't stand the thought of potentially losing both of my children. I was a child when I had my first and it took a lot of fucking up in order to get to where I am now. I am still trying to get everything in order, but I think I have come a long way from where I once stood.

TL;DR: Had a kid, became homeless, got kid back, got a job, got knocked up, never again.
