I wonder if any of those arrests have to do with more black people smoking/possessing weed in public? Not to mention how black this city is, especially with the age groups most likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses. What a meaningless statistic to base judgment on police race relations.

I'm a fan of Anno 2070 and I was wondering if it would be possible to have a collection of Anno 2070 building models as assets for Cities: Skylines?  
Like:   
 • The 4 types of houses (workers, employees, engineers, executives) from the 3 factions (eco, tycoon, tech) as R growables, the faction being chosen randomly or not and the type depending on density and level (LD lvl1-2: worker houses ; LD lvl3+: employee houses ; HD lvl1-2: engineer houses ; HD lvl3+: executive houses).  

 • The various farm (the buildings and fields, but not attached to each other, just randomly grown) models as random growables for I with agriculture specialization   

 • Tree nursery and sawmill models as random growables for I with forestry specialization

 • The basalt crusher, the rotary excavator, the iron smelter, the steelworks and gold smeltery models as random growables for I with ore specialization

 • Oil driller, oil refinery and plastic factory models as random growables for I with oil specialization

 • The wind park model for wind turbine ; the offshore wind park model for advanced wind turbine ; the solar tower generator model for the solar power plant ; the coal power station model for the coal power plant ; the nuclear power plant model for the nuclear power plant ; the hydroelectric power plant model for hydro power plant (probable not possible) ; and maybe the carbon factory model for oil power plant?  

 • Fire station, hospital and police station models for fire house, medical clinic and police station (or for the big ones, or even new intermediate serbice buildings)  

• Some ornemental building models for decorations!

The French have been mistreated in some areas, yes. But they are most certainly not disadvantaged like blacks in the US.  No Frenchman lynchings, no anglo-KKK, no anti-french voting laws.

Apologies, I misread your comment. I thought you were referring to police killing innocents in general and not the specific cases at the moment. 

Police in the USA have a bad record for killings, usually black people and it's often covered up or 'accepted'. 

Recently a number of these killings have been caught on camera and highly publicised causing riots in America and growing discontent. The effect increases and every killing grabs more attention.

ah, the ignorant fallacy.

completely ignore the fact that the US spends 19% of the federal budget on the military, yet 28% on healthcare, 24% on pensions, 10% on welfare, 3% on transportation, 3% on education, etc.

Then you have to consider that transportation and education are almost exclusively covered by state budgets, and welfare is shared with state budgets... so if you have issues with transportation or education, look at your state, not DC...

So when you add the Federal budget with the state budgets, you end up with the following order:

1. Health Care - $1.35T+

2. Pensions - $1.22T+

3. Education - $1T+

4. Defense - $840B+

5. Welfare - $522B+

6. Protection (police/various law enforcement agencies) - $335B+

7. Transportation - $300B+

Then you have to factor in the fact that various US allies/NATO members **fail to meet the NATO required GDP% spending**, and require the US to essentially subsidize their defense, while they bitch about US military spending. Must be nice to be a citizen of Canada, Germany, Italy, Poland, Denmark... fuck it, every single NATO member with the exception of UK, Turkey, France, and Greece. 2% GDP requirement for all nations in NATO, and Germany can't even meet 1.5%, while Canada can't even make 1%. But what 2 nations rely heavily on US forces to assist with securing their defense? 

It's getting pretty annoying hearing the same statement repeated over and over, especially when it's not even true... but ignorance prevails it seems.

i never understand this comment. i don't understand why a guy can get shot and the reaction of people is always 'herp derp where's al sharpton now'? it's got nothing to do with it. i'm not gonna show up to ask 'where's the NCLR *now*?' when an asian guy gets shot by police. 

like i don't understand how someone can look at an article like this and turn around and only come to the conclusion that the right thing to do is shit on two of the easiest targets who are hated by a ton of people, black or white, anyway. everyone knows the two guys in charge of the *NAACP* is going to stick up for black people first. it's like me getting pissy because the Asian American Action Fund didn't start wearing I Can't Breathe shirts.

like a guy is dead for no reason and people take the opportunity to shoehorn 'no one care's because he's white' into it because for once people *aren't* trying to shoehorn race into it. no wonder cops get away with this all the time, everyone reads the article and instead of getting irritated or demanding reform they just want to get their snark in. you don't need two random black guys' permission to get upset over a guy getting killed for no reason regardless of race, because it's clear that police brutality gets to *every* race eventually. when it happens to black people they protest it, when it happens to native americans they protest it, when it happens to latinos they protest it, when it happens to white people they sit back and go 'herp derp why doesn't al sharpton help us isn't he the president of all black people?'

While I don't like to overplan my trips and I prefer to live more in the moment, I also think that set and setting is important and needs to be considered a lot before commencing the trip. 

For example, my friend and I met up with our friend and a few if his friends over the weekend at our friends house (he still lives with his mom). We went to chill in a van (similar to a VW bus in that it has amenities and is spacious inside. They went to go get some liquor while my friend and I waited in the van. When they left, I ate 500ug of LSD and my friend ate 200ug. By the time they returned, I could already feel it strongly. We took some dabs in the van. Then my friend went inside. When he returned he told us that his mom knew we were in the van and that he was now homeless and kicked out of the house. We left and went to our cars. She came out yellig at is to get the fuck off her property. I was worried she would call the cops and the whole situation freaked me out a bit so I started to get anxious. I hit my peak literally right as we were leaving. I felt pretty anxious and due to the high dose, I was very disoriented and wasn't too sure where I was or what was happening. Eventually, I calmed down and had a great trip. 

Moral of the story though, make sure you take it in a place you're very comfortable/familiar with. It will help you out a lot during the trip

There needs to be some kind of racism evaluation before someone becomes a cop. If someone commits a crime, regardless of race, you arrest him/her. You question him/her. If someone doesn't commit a crime or you don't have enough information, you don't arrest him/her, regardless of race. It's really not that complicated.

It's as if people want more black people to commit crimes so their worldview can make sense. I mean, what's the chance of some kind of drug operation or murder going unsolved there? It would make more sense if cops behaved like this in a war torn country where they didn't have enough resources or time to check stuff.

Yeah, I think if we're using an American equivalent, its more akin to how the police get away with shooting black guys. 

Surely some of them are in the wrong (maybe most of them) but its hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt in any one case.  
Did this driver cause death by dangerous driving? Probably. Beyond reasonable doubt? It seems not.

Did that cop in Ferguson shoot that black kid unnecessarily? Maybe. Beyond reasonable doubt? Again, apparently not.

That's how it *usually* appears to work in the US.  But what actually is going on is more complicated.

It is not a direct hierarchy where the Federal government tells the states what to do and the states do it.  The Federal and state governments are co-sovereign, with some rules about whose opinion is supposed to supersede the other's.

For the most part, if a federal law is contravened by a state, the state law is supposed to be unenforceable.  It's still the law, though.  For example, some states have laws that prohibit atheists from holding public office.  The Federal courts have said those laws can't be enforced, and the states have obeyed that order.

What the US constitution does not address, though, is what happens when a state openly defies a federal court order.  Alabama's Supreme Court insists that Alabama has the right to ban gay marriage in defiance of the Federal court's rulings.  Presumably, they will continue to defy the federal court even if the US Supreme Court rules the bans unconstitutional.

The last time a state government openly defied an order of the US Supreme court was... let's see now... well golly gee!  It was *Alabama*.  In the 1960's, asserting that it had the right to prevent black students from attending a previously all-white state university (U of Alabama).

It provoked a "constitutional crisis".  We don't exactly know what is supposed to happen.  The US Supreme Court can issue a court order, but whether that ultimately is *advisory* or compulsory is an open question.  The Constitution does not explicitly give the Supreme Court the power of  a "writ of *mandamus*" over a state government, nor does it spell out how such a writ would be enforced.

As an example of a court order and a writ of *mandamus*:  If I sue you and get a judgment for $500, I get a court order that you should pay me.  It's up to me, though, to harass you into paying me.  The court generally doesn't issue the *mandamus* -- the order that a sheriff or constable shall seize your car, house, Rolex, gold necklace, etc and sell it to force you to pay me, until I've exhausted all other self-help remedies.

So that's just a quick explanation of the difference between the order and the writ.  We know the Court can order a state not to enforce a law.  We don't know if the Court can issue the writ to compel them.

In 1963, Alabama Gov. George Wallace refused to allow black students to enter a white university, in defiance of a Supreme Court order that segregation was unconstitutional.   He had the state police and the city of Tuscaloosa police guarding the school to make sure no black kids got in.

President Kennedy responded by sending in the National Guard to force their way past the police and to provide safety for the students to enter the school.

While nowadays we look back on that like "What the fuck was Wallace thinking?!?!" and we think that segregation is a horrible thing, the truth is that Kennedy had no constitutional authority to do it.  Right or wrong, he exceeded his authority.

What would have happened if one of state police had refused to back down?  We don't know.  There is literally no law on the subject -- and what's more, there is no constitutional means to create a law that resolves the issue.  Someone has to seize the initiative and assert some kind of authority or power that the other side will not ignore.

Another similar situation occurred when President Nixon was ordered by the Supreme Court to hand over tape recordings of conversations he had with high-ranking officials.  Can the Supreme Court issue a writ of *mandamus* to the President?  No one knows.  That question has only come up *twice* -- in 1973 and in 1806.

And both times, an alternative resolution was reached.  In 1806, the Court found the law that created the crisis unconstitutional and avoided the issue.  In 1973, Nixon capitulated and avoided the issue.  To his credit, Nixon was a constitutional scholar and understood full well the consequences of forcing a crisis.

This Alabama thing, with the incomparably nasty and evil Chief Justice Roy Moore, could play out like Tuscaloosa in 1963 all over again.

edit: To clarify the last statement:  Because technically, the court clerks of the state of Alabama have to obey the laws of the state of Alabama, and orders from their Supreme Court.  That's how the US "federalism" system works.

Some points you make I agree with, others, not at all:

"blah blah something being searched randomly shouldn't be a problem if you've got nothing to hide": The truth is, in America, black people get hassled by the police all the time. Stop and frisk laws let police pat down black folks for no reason at all, on their front porches, on the streets they live and work, etc. A black man in Florida was arrested for trespassing dozens of time AT HIS PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT. Dozens of times, he had to go to jail, in the middle of his shift. So it's not about "having nothing to hide." It's about not wanting to deal with this constant intrusion in your life by very aggressive, demeaning police officers. These intrustions happen to black people, almost exclusively. White folks who shrug and say, "if you've got nothing to hide ..." are part of the problem.

I won't pick apart some of the other points you made, but they are similar. Just because it's not your problem doesn't mean it's not a problem.

Yes, he does. Otherwise he will be a detriment to all his future teams and himself. And he should be okay with constructive criticism. If he is for some reason not okay with it, he needs to use the mute function, not the report one.

"No. He'll just argue about how gragas's skull has the density of an iron mace and bla bla bla"

Then the Gragas is the one who deserves to be reported.

&gt; maybe if they did a sobriety test before admittance it would actually do some good.

I'd suggest you read a little about the benefits of harm reduction facilities and programs rather than abstinence based programs. The entire [harm reduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction) article on wikipedia is well worth a read if you're unfamiliar with the principles of harm reduction.

But more specifically, [the section on alcohol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction#Alcohol) is particularly illuminating as it relates to your suggestion that individuals only gain access to care services if they are sober. This section is really interesting:

 &gt;Toronto's Seaton House became the first homeless shelter in Canada to operate a "wet shelter" on a "managed alcohol" principle in which clients are served a glass of wine once an hour unless staff determine that they are too inebriated to continue. Previously, homeless alcoholics opted to stay on the streets often seeking alcohol from unsafe sources such as mouthwash, rubbing alcohol or industrial products which, in turn, resulted in frequent use of emergency medical facilities. The programme has been duplicated in other Canadian cities and a study of Ottawa's "wet shelter" found that emergency room visit and police encounters by clients were cut by half.[72] **The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 2006 found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that programme participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 46 drinks a day when they entered the programme to an average of 8 drinks and that their visits to emergency rooms drop to an average of eight a month from 13.5 while encounters with the police fall to an average of 8.8 from 18.1.**

Try to approach this issue from a different perspective and hopefully you'll see that everything is not black and white as you propose.

just as cops go into the force to be heroes, right? and politicians go into their field to make a difference and scientists go into their fields to pursue truth. it's cute and it's ideal and it's what little kids want to be when they grow up. but not everybody loves their job; some do before the conditions of their work environment force them to resign to reality. even if you do, you don't have the tools, you don't have the administration, you don't have the parental involvement needed because they're busy working multiple jobs. your buildings are falling apart, nutrition is abysmal, and it's depressing. you don't get paid enough to work extra hours that kids need sometimes - hell, you don't even really get paid enough to be a good teacher. if you were, - if you had some higher quality education and better qualifications - some other more financially well-off school would have taken you. maybe you're a golden soul who really wants to help these kids, but you're not the standard.

The sheer number of different people advocating physical violence against this guy is appalling and disappointing.

You're right, he's loud, it's irritating to be panhandled. He pees on your car, sure, that's gross and inconvenient. He's so unwired in the head that he does these things but your remedy is to pump him full of pellets or volts or worse? That's everyone's first instinct? People wonder why the police get away with violence - well, it starts with citizens who advocate shooting homeless guys with pellet guns.

I lived in NW for 8 years and I know who this guy is but no one deserves to be shot or physically accosted for being loud or peeing. It's unfortunate that we have inadequate mental health services to help this guy but he's a person and deserves a certain level of compassion. He's a person, not a target for your Supersoaker.

&gt; No. It is not a huge assumption to suggest that the vast majority of people aren't crazy.

People who are not suffering a neurological disorder are subject to their emotional state.  People who are never swayed by feelings are crazy.  You have it backwards.  This is why we aspire to stoicism where it's useful.  Were that the default human state, then there would be nothing to aspire to.

&gt;No. It's not a problem. It's reality. 

Then it's reality that journalists will be replaced by AI.  It's interesting how you're ignoring the influence of punditry in media.  Conversations don't exist, right?  "Story" is very nearly an outmoded term in the context of modern media because we're no longer limited to stating the bald facts with as much brevity as possible, on expensive paper printed upon with expensive ink using expensive machines and services, to be manually sold by an expensive army of employees.

&gt;This became about redditors instead of journalism when you took it that way. 

I didn't take anything about this conversation to imply anything about redditors.  Do you really think that you represent the millions of people on this site?

&gt;I never said the media shouldn't have humanity. Exactly the opposite, in fact.

Then you're stubbornly arguing a point without thinking about it first.  

&gt;I've never defended what they did with the Michael Brown coverage, nor have I defended them here or elsewhere. 

Really?  You seem to have explicitly argued that they should not have covered that story any differently.  But then again, you have also stunted your own credibility by suggesting the police shootings and riots aren't a story.

&gt;Just like Michael Brown shouldn't have been a story. 

Let's get to the real meat of your ideas here, since you post that now.

&gt;The human element is exactly why journalism is important. But not for emotional reasons. Journalists need to filter out the things that tug at the heartstrings, the things that make you pause and say "that makes me feel good" or "that makes me feel bad" and instead give the public stories that make them think. 

Journalists can not impose upon others any state of emotion or lack thereof, nor is it reasonable to assume that human beings will never be emotionally affected by the events in their communities.  Human beings are hard-wired pack animals to such an extent that it causes neurological damage for a person to be isolated for too long.  

We can agree that it's ideal that people stop and think rather than react according to their impulses, but it's also incredibly naive to think that the masses will always do so, no matter how stories and discussion topics are presented.  We can not control other people, period.  We can not even by force cause a person's internal state of mind to be as we choose.

Accepting reality for what it is means that we need to remain aware of the ways that stories affect emotions, thinking in turn, and thereby, behavior.  Failure to do so encourages harm.  Giving the masses cause to riot without cause to think produces or prolongs riots.  

&gt;Could this particular clip be a small piece in a larger story? Of course. 

That's exactly what I'm saying should happen, and not with this clip as the sole source material for the purpose.  When it is easily predictable that a story will engage people emotionally in a way that can lead to harm, it is also easily predictable that mixing in content to sway their emotions the other way will lead more people to stop and think.  

When masses of people are outraged, angry at the police, frustrated and fed up with the state of the legal system, and swayed by ideas of disenfranchisement, it is very easily predictable that their frustration and outrage will be vented outwardly when that is encouraged.  When people see a police officer who is genuinely suffering after shooting somebody, it engages their mirror neurons, they empathize with the officer, and thereby they reconnect on some level with the human behind the badge.  That connection is too often neglected because we don't often get the opportunity to empathize with people whose humanity is hidden behind a uniform's mask of authority.

Yep, for women,blacks, Chinese, they are way behind since its like the KKK up there. Their Chief mandated it and they are hiring minorities and women like crazy..to the dismay of senior officers....or so I "hear".

PS. Lot's f people "know" cops, it doesn't mean the cop talks freely in front of them, I highly doubt you are close friends with any cop since they rarely have friends outside of the force. They are miserable to be around and 5 years into the force- rarely have non cop friends. My father is an old goof cop. Hated by his superiors but absolutely loved by his colleagues. I get to hear their drunken bullshit almost weekly. At your age, they will see you as an old dog who can't be trusted because they weren't "broken" into the system at a young age. In your mind you are "experienced", educated and rubbed shoulders on "bay st" (lmfao)- their eyes you are an old dog who was not indoctrinated into the system and can't trusted to turn a blind eye or lie when the shit hits the fan. Trust me on that. But you ain't getting in the force... trust me sweetie.

Like you OP, I drive defensively and usually slightly over the limit, but not enough to get me in trouble unless there is a cop around who doesn't know how to pick their battles.  I've never been in an accident except for one time when I hit a deer but that was an unavoidable occurrence (as in, speeding up in a higher-speed zone on the outskirts of town on a dark and foggy night, was at about 50mph when a large white-tail deer ran into the road 10 feet from my bumper, no time to react.)  

There was one time when I picked up what I think was an unfortunate, crazy homeless guy hitch-hiking.  On the way to the next town, among other things, he started babbling and talking to entities which weren't there and telling me how he lived in a cardboard box with his girlfriend and 27 kids and was trying to get a job as a teacher.  I felt bad for him but holy crap, he scared the bejeezus out of me.

Ok, so I'm not going to argue current police policy with you, you are clearly far more knowledgeable than I. I will respond to your request for an alternative approach. How about the police officers in the video started by talking to people and attempted to de-escalate the situation. I saw no attempt to do this at all. They went straight for overwhelming force.
If you think this man deserved to die, you clearly do not value human life. If you can only see this one outcome, the killing of an unarmed man, as being the reasonable one, I suspect you can only see him as an enemy. You say that by trying to defend himself from 6 armed men as reason enough to kill him, I think that is disgraceful. If you can't imagine another way to deal with the homeless and mentally ill, you are not trying very hard.

If you rant about OJ simpson, no issue. If you rant about black people, well you're going to have a lot of people pissed about your ignorance, yeah?     

Same concept. Right or wrong people **Will** defend others that they associate with to some extent. There are plenty enough stories of cops being charged and PD's being sued and losing however to evidence that the entire system is not corrupt and that they will only defend others they identify with so far.     

So remove that identity and see them as the individual.

&gt;I absolutely want more women to discuss gaming with. Some of my best fucking friends are women who I discuss gaming with, My guild leaders when I played WoW, who were some of my best friends at the time, were a woman and her husband...Yes, SHE was the leader, he was the co-leader.

Um.. I'm glad you feel that way. really. However "I have friends who are X" is a common excuse that people use when they are being called out for being prejudice in a range of contexts, I really hope you're not as aggressive as you've been in your comments otherwise I wouldn't expect they would engage with you.

TO BE CLEAR I'm not claiming you hate women, what i'm saying is that your posts indicate to me that you have some sexist beliefs/tendencies and whether you realize/ intend it or not, you contribute to a culture of IMPLICIT sexism through the ignorance you've demonstrated. if you're going to be using the words implicit and straw-man interchangeably you've got to realize they apply to you. 

To say that the female critiques of games are causing other women to be pushed out of gaming is the most ludicrous bit of victim blaming I've heard. That's American Tea Party stuff. Would you say gay people are the cause of homophobia in the military? Black people are the cause of civil rights violations inflicted by police force? cartoonists are the cause violent acts committed by terrorists? This isn't straw-man tactics, its taking your ideas to their logical conclusions with other issues so as to point out how thoughtless and ridiculous they are. 

finally:

&gt;Personally, I like hearing differing views and opposite opinions. I like arguing/debating with people. I think its fun, even heated debates(as long as they stay debates and not just insult slinging). the problem usually is people can't handle being proven wrong. THEY don't want an argument, they don't want a debate. they want to make a statement and have it be taken as fact, and as soon as you disprove it they plug their ears and shout 'LALALALALALA I'M NOT LISTENING"

What hypocrisy from Mr go-fuck-yourself-if-you-think-otherwise.

In my city recently they passed a ballot issue trying to lessen the punishment for first time marijuana possession charge.

They aren't trying to get it legalized out right.  Just lessen the effects of the first charge.  

Funny thing when you look at the numbers from our courts.  35% - 40% of first time offenders were black.  Yet they are only 11% of the population.   

That probably doesn't make any hurt feelings in our local black community.  

Even on a national level blacks are more likely to be arrested for marijuana than whites.  

Often times police in the news and even on this sub say they are just enforcing the "law as it is written".  They have no choice.  The law is the law and they are carrying out their orders.

Yet when it comes time to address these issues and a proposal is made to change the law one of the first groups to to soapbox screaming not to change anything are the police unions and their lobbying groups.

The war on drugs, and especially on marijuana, has failed.  It's failed for decades.  But still some of the most money funneled into the effort to keep marijuana illegal comes from police unions, private prisons and prison guard unions.

The police and their unions would appear to keep a system and a set of laws in place that have been a abject failure for decades which disproportionately harm and in many cases ruin the lives of black and Hispanic people so that they can keep receiving federal grants and civic fines to pay for their over time, additional police officers, and new equipment.

"Black Lives Matter" isn't just about shooting people in the back.  

This all goes much deeper than that.  It's about everything.  It's about stop and frisk.  It's about arrests for contempt of cop.  It's about driving while black.  It's about a Justice system that preys on the poor.  

Police unions lobby to put more and more non-violent people in prison while depending on the arbitration process to shield cops when the cities try to punish or rid themselves of "Bad Apples".

If the sheriffs and policing agencies were serious about improving their relationship with the black community and America as a whole they're lobbying efforts to keep arresting and imprisoning as many people as possible would change along with the unbelievable effort to keep corrupt or just incompetent men and women in uniform.

Don't kid yourself into thinking the phrase "Black Lives Matter" is a new concept and these are new over the top feelings.  The issues causing this have been around for a very very long time.

However, getting phones that have video cameras in them that shoot in 1080p at 60fps with the ability to share it with the world almost instantly over a broadband network is a rather newer event.

I agree with everything you're saying, but people do not react the same way to stress in their lives, in part because of how society is structured. Poor people in particular have access to fewer positive coping mechanisms for the immense stressors in their lives. High population density, police harassment, living in a violent community, no/terrible job, poor transportation, having access to fewer resources, dealing with poverty, etc.=a high stress life. 

People who live high stress lives tend to make serious errors in judgment which further causes stress. That can eventually compound into murder in some cases. This is not to say that murder is justified and people aren't responsible for their actions; only that there may be things we as a society can do to prevent SOME murder, rather than merely address ALL murder after the fact. And isn't that the point of a society? To create a system that makes things better for everyone together, compared to how they'd fare individually?

why do so many blacks hate the police? is it because the police are always foiling their plans?
<MAYBE>

What's with the animosity towards sociology? I'm guessing you didn't do so well in that class? 

Because the vast majority of black people manage to perform respectability and law-abiding-ness so flawlessly that racist cops can't pin anything on them--except it's still exhausting and exacts a huge toll that constantly keeps them down. 

Thus the fact that the black community has never recovered from being kidnapped, enslaved, and terrorized repeatedly for hundreds of years up to the present under shifting rationales...

Don't be a dumb ass. Feminism stole it's template for activism from the civil rights movement of blackS who didn't have prosperous white men supporting their families.   Race and gender aren't the same. You can't debunk racial oppression like you can with gender. Reading the statistics make that s all too apparent not to mention white hostility towards blacks demonstrated at the institutional level while women and white women in particular are America's favorite victims no matter how much privelege they have. Notice the only reason blacks came up on the radar would be the tens of thousands protesting on the streets for years so police won't beat the shit out of them or shoot them dead without consequences. 

Instead of fighting for (black) men in men's rights agents of white hostility try to undermine the legitimacy from their struggle as if not wanting police to beat or kill you was a evidence of entitlement. Get fucking real.

Anyone else wondering why is this shit always coming up every winter? Don't get me wrong but It's like - governments, , the rich, corporations and brainwashed people don't like homeless all other seasons, they build anti-homeless spikes, they'd want to see the homeless somewhere far away in a ghetto, police harasses the homeless constantly, etc. But as the temperatures drop, suddenly, the hearts melt. Someone explain me this.

Niggers don't know how well they have it in the USA. Free food, housing, healthcare and they still complain about being "oppressed". 

They complain about police brutality when they actively resist, commit crimes, and assault officers. I know it sounds hard to believe, but US officers show extreme restraint and are hesitant when dealing with nigs compared to other countries. If all the US nigs went to Russia or Germany today I guarantee the police over there would act the same as US police.

I understand her anger, and frustration. I can understand why there is so much hatred, but I must disagree with her comments about hating a specific race. It's not necessarily "whites vs blacks". It's old ways of thinking  clashing with the new. I think old ideas backed by racists upbringings that were reinforced by ignorant adults, which then clash with those who question those old racists upbringings, is the reason behind the riots. Everyone has had a bad experience in that regard, but that doesn't make all in that race "bad". It was in the 1960s that laws were created to protect ALL Americans, not just the fair skinned of the land. If you consider your grandma/ grandpa, coming from the perspective of a 27 year old, it's likely they had racists upbringing. It was a different time back then, much more brutal and less benefit of doubt was given. For ducks sake, it was okay to kill men and woman in trees. It's been a few decades since that time, and now we are coming to the crossroads. Does a specific race choose to fight on behalf of all of us non-whites? If her "friends" see a Hispanic man, for example, with fair-skin complexion, does that automatically make that person anti-black? No, that person in that video speaks for herself,  and no one else. It's this type of hatred that kills people. It's that type of attitude that will ignite another police murder, not out of spite, but by fear of not acting on the situation on the cops behalf. Hell, some  cops might retaliate out of spite, but that's another story. Vigilante cop judges should tried, and not shielded from the laws they enforce. Not one cop should ever be above the law, period. That should be the rhetoric behind the protests, not destroying businesses or harming innocent people.

&gt; Have you seen the rates at which they commit violent crimes? When you're 6.5% of the population and committing half of the fucking violent crime, I think the extra policing is justifiable.

The problem with this argument is that most arrests and searches aren't for violent crimes. Most are for non-violent offenses, where there is no significant disparity between Black and White crime rates (drug crimes, for example). Violent crime makes up a small minority of all crimes involving police.  With the percentages as they are, there's no way to justify the disparate policing, even when you take the disproportionate amount of Black violent crime into account. Black people are overpoliced no matter how you slice it.

Unfortunately, a good friend of mine.  There's a 85% chance that any attempt at conversation with him will be meet with a non-sequitur, some form of trolling or contrary response, or a matter-of-fact declaration of "I know" (or some variation).  
Listen dude, I just want to have fucking grown up conversations with you.  Responding to "it's beautiful outside" (when, in fact, it is) with "no it's not" isn't funny.  It just makes me not want to talk to you.  If I inform you of something, it's because I DON'T think you know, so don't cop an attitude if you already did... but half the time he DIDN'T fucking know.  
  
Sorry, needed to rant for a minute.  Thanks.

Let me guess, if I read this article am I going to find out the guy assaulted the officer first and was physically attacking the officer? 

If so, he had it coming. Your a fucking idiot if you think fighting a cop is a good decision. 

Buuuut all of reddit will be up in arms, claiming for the cops head, and stand up for the drugged up homeless maniac who does nothing for our society. Yup yup yup. 

Edit: Article throws it in your face how the cop was white and the dead guy was black, already detecting bias.

"Someone called 911 to report a man "acting deranged, knocking on doors and crawling around naked," Alexander said.

When the officer arrived, the man charged at him, Alexander said.

'The officer called him to stop while stepping backward, drew his weapon and fired two shots,' he said.

The man, struck twice in the upper body, died. Police later learned he was a resident at the complex."

So the guy charged at a cop after acting like a maniac, cop yelled to stop, he didn't. Sure, the cop could have used a stun gun or some spray in the eyes, but can't really say the cop was in the wrong here. Sorry folks!

&gt; Let's suppose you're walking through New York, lost, at 1:00am. You see a building with - wonder of wonders - a security guard at the front desk. You knock on the door and ask directions, and go on your way.
&gt; That's white privilege. A black person, even in a suit and tie, could expect to be ignored at best, or more likely, have the police called on him. Only white people get to assume that everyone will help them.

That doesn't sound like New York City at all, dude. There are 2 million black people in NYC, many of them extremely affluent. I get your point but pick another city to make it :P

NYC is probably the most color-blind city in America.

Users != dealers.

So you're saying the problem isn't that blacks are drug dealers, it's that they are targeted more. 

If you target crack dealers in an area notorious for drug trafficking, do you just let the white ones go?

Answer something, anything, instead of just humming into your own echo chamber.

Also, why does Ferguson police policy dictate how things are done in Baltimore, where a large part of the police force AND the chief of police is black? How are those the same in your mind?

No safety inspections in WA state, which is unfortunate because there are a lot of junk cars on the road. But will go into the DMV maybe one morning this week or Saturday just depends on work. Car is not moving again until it goes to emissions testing which is next door to the DMV and like 2 miles from my apartment. I was surprised the cop let me off but my record is clean, first time being pulled over since college like 5 years ago ha. Might go to the local u pull today and see if the one they had listed on inventory has any parts I need.

You've framed the question in such a way that neither answer is correct. Cops don't just go around looking for black kids to kill, and the media only report on it because they know people care about it and they'll tune in.

It's probably most accurate to say that the black population in America is stuck in a cycle of crime and poverty, which in turn causes them to have a disproportionate amount of encounters with police, which in turn engenders racist resentment among both the police and the black community. 

If black people weren't committing such an enormous chunk of America's violent crime, they almost certainly wouldn't be getting shot by police so often, but it they weren't having their families systemically ripped apart by federal drug policy, they almost certainly wouldn't be committing so much violent crime in the first place.

Ohh crap, not this nonsense again. 

Racism, is a form of tribalism. Conservatism, as this sub likes to point out is a "Fuck you I got mine", therefor an individualistic P.O.V. Liberalism, also as this sub likes to point out is a collectivist P.O.V. On clearly better aligns with racism. Even more when you consider the liberals keep with policies that state that given fair and equal standing minorities are unable to compete with white people. Which I think any black person should feel insulted by, but few seem to make the connection. 
 

Racism? You mean like how the DOJ tried to stop the video showing that "gentle giant" Brown stealing from the store? Roughing up the store owner because it went against the mantra they were trying to play up? Or do you mean how the DOJ tied the cops hands while the usual rioting and looting and assaults went on unabated(That hurt physically, emotionally and financially how many blacks? Don't their lives matter?)? Or do you mean how after Wilson was shown to have done his job, that this sub and the DOJ's Pavlovian response to painting the white guy as the criminal and excusing, hiding, and obstructing all the evidence that showed it was Brown that was the criminal and maker of his own demise simply dropped it without even a hint of apologizing for attempting to ruin a man's life? 

Heck, they/this sub, did the same thing in regards to Trayvon, and to the same ends. They/This sub, were wrong, horribly wrong and tried to ruin someones life because it fit their narrative. A narrative based on race. 

A few days after Holder and the DOJ got pants from the decision, then he comes out with this report, as if it isn't obvious to anyone paying attention that this is just as some pay-back for being shown as the racist he is(again).

Conservatives aren't racists(By and large)

The riots were caused by the death of a black man in a prominent afro-carribean area of London, Tottenham. First riots were from Tottenham's afro carribean community, then it spread and was mainly poor people.

There have been several riots in Brixton in the past aswell, another very black area of London, because of police brutatlity to black locals.
