I second this. Unfortunately I have been in a similar situation and can say that if he DID NOT ask for forgiveness or even want to talk about what happened, it's a huge RED FLAG. Hopefully you have a close family member or friend nearby who you can confide in-- someone who will stick by your side as you make a decision about the relationship... and someone who will keep you accountable to act in your own best interest (and not minimise the situation).

&gt; I guess this would be to protect vulnerable partners who do not plan ahead for a split when they start sharing finances?

Essentially, yes. There are couples who live several decades together without ever getting married, and it would be fundamentally unfair to treat them as simply roommates if they split.

&gt;I wasn't aware there was a a way to opt out, besides essentially making an agreement that nulls any asset-splitting implications of being common-law (unless that's exactly what you mean).

A cohabitation agreement would operate like a prenup for your common-law relationship. Just spell out exactly what you want to happen if you split up.

From your OP:

&gt;We're both young and not particularly wealthy, but we do each have our own savings, investments, and debts, and expensive items we paid for ourselves our brought into the relationship. We'd essentially like something that declares we each own our own things and are not exercising anything marriage-like over each others' assets. 

It might differ in BC, but generally assets you bring into a marriage (common-law, in this case) is exempt from division, as are inheritances and a few other things.

I think most guys don't understand how women can be attracted to men is because female sexuality is portrayed as erotic and desirable whereas male sexuality is presented is disgusting, creepy, and predatory. It's not about men being so self-centered that they can only think in terms of what they are attracted to, it's about how male attractiveness is shown. It's par for the course in media for women to be portrayed as beautiful and gorgeous and having to fend off aggressive scummy guys trying to hit on her, whereas the men are often either a smooth-talking chiseled stud superhero or a dorky bumbling idiot that has trouble attracting anyone ever, and most people identify more with the latter than the former. The common societal narrative is basically "Women are precious delicate flowers that everyone wants, and men are a bunch of gross hairy horndogs that will fuck anything that walks" 
*except for the few super classy perfectly in shape millionaire Prince Charming action heroes. 

While most people aren't going to outright agree with this statement, it plays a huge role in interactions between men and women and what people believe about the others' sexualities.

RoyRW, I just got back on and read the rest of the thread.  For me personally, only a relationship with God saved me from myself and helped me become "happy." No one is totally happy and not every day for sure. But I am seeing the Nfamily for what they are and detaching from them and I divorced by Nhusband five years ago.  And only through the guidance of God.  I go to a modern rock n roll church, it is a methodist church but the music is rock and it is very spiritual and meaningful. No blame, no shame.  Half the crowd is gay, some homeless, some old married people like me, black, white, etc.  Tons of young folks and a young adult minister that cares. There are churches like this and going to one could help you find a spiritual path that leads to better life. And yes, we have to stop the toxicity that we do to ourselves, that we put into our bodies before we can heal our souls.  And weed is really bad for your brain and your soul. Addictions separate us from the lover of our souls, aka, God. I am hoping so much good for you and sending you anonymous peace and love.

The message "NAWALT, if anything goes wrong in a relationship the man is responsible, getting married (2.0) is the *ultimate* goal" is fucking everywhere. It's not mentioned, not hinted at, it's stuffed down our fucking throats.

Never underestimate the extent to which humans will conform when the areas of the brain that criticise are not engaged. Also, these rich men are ambitious, and they often get blindsided even in their ambitions by this conditioning - you better believe that if he's successful in every other way, that strong imperative to get hitched (read: sucked dry and then divorce-raped) is going to burn in him like a fire. He'll believe that he's a failure without it, a 90% successful modern man.

&gt; Hypergamy is something that both genders participate in equally. Hypergamy is looking/marrying someone "out of your league", and almost everyone is guilty of trying to get the Best they can. Goldigging women want rich men, older men want young beautiful women, ect. This is not news to most people.

I don't think you truly understand what hypergamy is because I don't think you know what Sexual Market Value is... So let me explain.

Sexual Market Value is different for men and women. It's 'what you bring to the table' in terms of a relationship.

Men can increase their SMV by being physically, socially, mentally (being smart) and financially successful. This is the male standard of SMV. The more traits you are successful in, and the degree in which you are successful in each trait, the higher a man's SMV is.

* Physical Success - Dressed well, eats well, exercises constantly, has a fit body.
* Social Success - Being assertive and confident and with a 'Don't take shit from anybody' attitude. Social success is probably the most important trait in terms of getting women (Pick Up Artists are widely successful in this trait). Social success is a lot more than this, but that would take up an entire post on its own.
* Mental Success - Being educated and constantly striving to learn more, despite failures. This is your ambition, your passion, your intelligence, all of which are attractive qualities in a man.
* Financial Success - The use of a combination or all of the above traits to acquire wealth. This is your career.

Now just by looking at these 4 traits, you'll notice that they are ALL hard to achieve. This is not the case for women's standards of SMV.

Women can increase their SMV by being physically beautiful and being socially 'nice'. Women are NOT more attractive for being a doctor or some famous writer or some prestigious career shit like that. Nor are they coveted for their intelligence (sorry, but it's the truth). Scarlett Johansson is attractive REGARDLESS of her career as an actress. She can be a janitor and men will still gather around to have a chance with her. In fact, the more successful a woman is in the male standard, the *less* options she'll have in mates. Now, being successful in terms of the male standard doesn't necessarily make her LESS attractive, but it changes her choices in mates due to her hypergamy.

Hypergamy is the need to mate with a male of equal or higher status (SMV). Women will NEVER date below their own SMV and will CONSTANTLY compare her SMV (her looks and social success) with a man's SMV (his physical, social, mental and financial success). If she deems her SMV is higher than his, she wil NOT have any attraction for him whatsoever. At best, if he has financial success, she'll only be with him so that she lives a comfortable life. This is where guys from /r/DeadBedrooms comes in. Their wives are not sexually attracted to them, but are attracted to the lifestyle. 

Now just by looking at the 2 female SMV traits, you'll notice that they are EASY to achieve compared to the 4 male SMV traits. This is EXACTLY why sluts are shamed and players are praised. It's easy to be a slut. But it's hard to be a player due to the constant need to maintain and IMPROVE a man's SMV.

**But in regards to your comment about older men dating women,** the reason why older men tend to date younger women is due to both of their SMVs:

* Older men tend to have established lives and are usually more successful (in the 4 traits) than their younger male counterparts. This makes them more attractive to women. Young men are still striving to reach the same level of success as older men. This is why older men are more attractive to women.
* Younger women tend to be more physically attractive than older women. This is why younger women are more attractive to men. That is all.

You'll notice that this dynamic compliments each other *perfectly*, as is the natural order of things. Young beautiful women date older men and both parties win.

EDIT: In terms of intelligence, I know a lot of people reading will think "OH so TRP really thinks women are stupid?" That's not what I said. Intelligence simply isn't coveted in a woman in terms of sexual attraction. It's her physical beauty that first attracts a man and her personality that determines whether or not he'll want to stay. Intelligence simply isn't a factor. A slutty woman only has her physical beauty to attract a man; she does not have the personality to keep him.

I said before that black women had the lowest % of interracial marriage its 9% and it was way higher than that for black men. I guess there are lots of stats out there. Black women are the least popular group in the USA and least likely to marry, so I have given up trying to. My Asian stat was way off too I think I got an okcupid dating stat mixed up in my head.

when too many people go to college, those degrees lose value and become the norm. It's a good thing people go to college and our entire society would benefit from it if near everyone went. However, to excel now, while in college, you actually have to apply yourself outside of college.. get those internships, volunteer, market yourself, get those letters of recommendations from professors, get those higher degrees from the better schools. This is just life.. the same applies in the work force, you have to be assertive, aggressive, ambitious, driven towards what you want. The net of it is if you really don't try, you won't get anywhere. And no, trying is not working at a company that pays too little, jumping ship every few months for another job that pays too little. Trying is taking the initiative to do what it takes to earn more money

&gt;  Furthermore the unemployment rate has never been zero. So the system is intrinsically flawed, regardless of personal choice

System is not flawed, the economy is a living and breathing entity. Jobs are lost, jobs are created.. typically, most commonly, more jobs are created than are lost by this entity. If we were to mandate jobs, many people would have to move, but everyone would have a job at they often occur outside your area. 
The closest thing we can do to mandating everyone getting a job is to (prepare before doing so) start reducing unemployment benefits, maybe even privatize it and let it act as actual insurance, not a entitlement. 

Also, it amazes me that people that are up in arms about getting $15 an hour for all employees aren't more concerned about labor force protections. Since nafta and 13 other free trade agreements, the US has lost thousands of middle class manufacturing jobs.. no peeps heard. There are around 11 millions illegals in this country taking semi-skilled to skilled labor jobs that typically pay well above $10/h.. no peeps heard. 

This isn't a single headed beast

1) IF it did actually mean that just two guys in a loving relationship is a sin (which it may be, I'm not perfect), than yes, God's forgiveness would cover those persons' sins as Christ's blood is sufficient for any who believe in God, whether or not they realize its a sin or not. 
An argument for this would be in the early 1900's where violence and hatred against blacks was commonplace and seen as right, even though this violates Christ's message of love and to "love your neighbor as yourself". Those people are in heaven even though they sinned unrepentantly.

2) Also in the OT it talks about not eating certain foods, about worshipping a very certain way, about not mixing dairy and meat. These commands were for the Jews to set them apart from the rest of humanity. When Christ returned only those things which were repeated from the OT still apply.

So true! I recommend prayer to everyone, even atheists, when they come up to talk to me one-on-one while I'm street preaching. It was not until I started praying that I began to consciously feel God and build trust in Him. It was exactly as described in this passage, although my prayer was laced with more desperation:

&gt;“I prayed. ‘Dear God, I know… that you do not exist. Nonetheless, as a scholar, I am forced to entertain the hypothetical possibility that I am mistaken. So just in case I am mistaken, please reveal yourself to me in some fashion that will prove your case. If you do not answer, I can safely assume that either you do not care whether I believe in you, or that you have no power to produce evidence to persuade me…If you do not exist, this prayer is merely words in the air, and I lose nothing but a bit of my dignity. Thanking you in advance for your kind cooperation in this matter, John Wright.'”

&gt;Wright soon received the answer (and effect) he did not expect:

&gt;“Something from beyond the reach of time and space, more fundamental than reality, reached across the universe and broke into my soul and changed me…I was altered down to the root of my being…It was like falling in love.”

My friend and I currently have one person who we are witnessing to on a regular basis... He wants to believe, but hasn't broken through that barrier yet. He is reading the Bible and I think he is praying but I am not sure. Please pray for him! He's a great guy and would bring much glory to our Heavenly Father. We also witnessed last night to a lovely pair of "partners" that are traveling/homeless. They are well taken care of but do not have a relationship with Christ. The man knows the Bible very well but takes a more... hippie?... approach to the world. Sorry, I do not know how to better describe it. The girl is a loving, sweet person who has not considered having a relationship with our Lord. Please pray that our conversation last night may stick with them and convict them to try out prayer or seek God.

I'm not so certain, the statement that being bald means you will be poor and unsuccessful is unsupported, start looking at the rich of the world and you will see quite a bit of diversity. My wife fell in love with me as a bald man, she thinks I'm wonderful and successful as a professional and a father. And she's admittedly beautiful, no problem meeting men, but she chose me because she sees something greater than a balding scalp. What would your girlfriend's reaction be to recommending breast implants? A lot of people think that's what makes a woman attractive and successful.

&gt; I don't care if American women women have all those that you mention. I have a sister and once had a mom. What I am talking about is how loud and masculine women have become. They think they are supposed to have as much or more testosterone than men. It is disgusting. Over the 30 years I have been an adult I have seen the transformation in American women. It is not about being assertive. It is like they have lost their femininity with their egos, there is nothing humble about them anymore. They are loud, trashy, and think being slutty equates them with the machismo that is inherent in too many men. They scream and throw fits as if what they see on television is ok. The reason I date foreign wome born and raised in their country is because there still exists a softness about them. There are exceptions to everything. But over all if they get pissed they don't go berserk. Many I have dated never raise their voice in anger. They are firm in their stance and do it with the maturity lacking in far too many American woman.

&gt;"It's not racist, it's just a preference."

&gt;I'm sick and tired of hearing this all throughout my life. I was born in this country yet I get treated like an immigrant. I follow the country's cultures, traditions, speak the language in the 'right' accent, support the local sports teams etc. Yet I will always be viewed as a race, not as an individual. These women have been dehumanising me since I was a kid. A lot of them say that I'm just not "their type".

&gt;They know that racism is wrong and if you publicly admit that you are a racist you will get ostracised. Yet, society accepts subtle racism all the time. In fact even expects it. You'd think this would be the exception, not the norm. But it's the exact opposite. Racist women have ruined my self esteem. How would you feel if no woman found you attractive simply because of your race? I went on /r/amiugly and asked for an honest rating of my face. Most people said I was between a 6 and an 8. I even asked on other websites and they all say I'm not an ugly guy and am moderately attractive. But my race is supposedly at the bottom of the social ladder.
Whenever I go to clubs or bars and I approach women, they put on a face that looks as if they are repulsed. The other day I approached a girl who I thought was all by herself. She politely declined my advances and we both went on our separate ways. She thought I had left the bar when in fact I had just popped into the bathroom. When I came back, this girl was with her friends. The friends had watched me try to hit on her. They were all saying things along the lines of, "Oh my god! I can't believe that Indian guy tried to ask you out." They were teasing her. You could sense it in their tone. They were making fun of her, as if trying to say that the girl was unattractive and could only get hit on by Indian guys. They were all laughing it up.

&gt;I once used Tinder. In my profile, I just had a blank picture as my profile pic. There was one girl who matched with me who also had a blank profile pic and we started talking. Eventually the topic of hook ups came up. We talked a lot about our fantasies etc. Then we agreed to meet and have a one night stand. We still hadn't seen each other's faces. I had warned her that a lot of girls don't find me attractive and that she might be disappointed. These were her exact words- "as long as you are not a morbidly obese hairy woman, you are fine." Both her and I were quite sexually frustrated and we just needed to get off. She gave me her address and I drove to her place. She walked up to my car, opened the door and said "oh". I thought to myself, 'not again'. We talked for literally about 5 seconds and then she said, "you shouldn't have lied to me". I told her I had warned her not many people find me attractive, she said "OK" and then shut my door. You could see she was clearly embarrassed and walked back to her house as quickly as possible. She literally thought I was as or less attractive than a morbidly obese hairy woman. How would that make you feel? I'm not fat, I'm of above average height, I get a haircut regularly yet I'm treated as if I'm something less than human.

&gt;These are just a few incidents out of many. So many. It's the story of my life. Racist women want equality but will not give it to others. How would you feel if I disguised sexism as a preference. "Oh, I don't hire women because they could get pregnant and eat up valuable company time. It's not sexist, it's just a preference." Or, "I don't want a woman doctor to be in charge of my child's health. It's not sexist, just a preference."

&gt;Racist women stripped me of a normal childhood. When other guys were going to high school dances, I was made to feel ashamed of the fact that I would even want to go. I was made to feel ashamed of even having a girlfriend. 'What would people think if they saw a girl with a subhuman?' In school, other guys could normally talk to girls and even have friends who were girls. Me? Even if I attempted to talk to them, they'd try to end the conversation as quickly as humanly possible. But then my white friend talks to them, they are all smiles and happy and friendly.
These feelings of shame carried through my college years. I didn't make a single friend during those 4 years. Society views a man's worth by the quantity and quality of women he can pull. If women are repulsed by you, what does that make you? An emasculated man. A eunuch. All my confidence and self worth went drown the drain. I graduated from college but have been unemployed for over a year. Not because I didn't get any jobs, but because I haven't even applied. I'm terrified of people. I get extreme social anxiety. My heart races when I have to talk to someone. No one owes me sex. But stop treating me like I am unworthy of love.

&gt;It sucks, right? You get treated differently and there isn't much you can do about it. Fact is, I'm not ugly either. If you asked a person they'd say I was average looking. The only thing is my race. They all assume I smell, am a secret rapist, treat women disrespectfully etc. Those were common sentiments among most women. In fact it was the norm, not the exception. It's just so hypocritical that these women want equality between the sexes but when it comes to equality between the races, the simply throw it out the window.

&gt;I have never had luck with women, and a lot of the reason is because I'm South Asian. I can't grow a beard, my features are too feminine for them. A lot of women in this country are gigantic by South Asian standards - the amount of obesity here doesn't help either. We supposedly live in a non racist society but it's bullshit. The first thing anyone notices is our race.

&gt;Whenever I'm walking down the street and I see a hot woman, if she's with a guy it will usually be a tall, bearded white guy. Only rarely will it be a minority dude. Men of colour are all in the same boat. We're all undermined by white supremacy in different ways. Asian men are emasculated. Black men are locked up and set up to fail economically. Hispanic men are invisible or treated like foreigners.
Hollywood movies like Guardians of the Galaxy just reinforce the mantra that white men = the only men. Superheroes are always white men. When's the last time there was a black, Asian or Hispanic super hero? Shaft? The only time men of color get to play leading roles is when it's a historical movie dealing with race oppression, like 12 years a slave or selma. Those movies are more about white guilt and showing the misery of being black in America that showing men of color in a positive, contemporary light.

If I didn't know better, I'd say it was written by Elliot Rodger himself.

&gt; I'm assuming the stadium for the QWC is bigger than the one at Hogwarts. Is there a standard for stadiums? Are all professional games played on the same sized stadiums?

The [HP wiki entry for Quidditch pitches](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Quidditch_pitch) gives measurements – they seem to come from Quidditch Through the Ages. I don't think the Hogwarts grounds are too small for a pitch of that size.

&gt; how do house elves procreate? Do they fuck? Do they get organised relationships by their masters?

We know that both Kreacher and Winky have ancestors who already served the Black and Crouch families respectively, but we don't know of any family with more than one house-elf, so it can be assumed they're simply ordered to mate another family's elf and the offspring is distributed between the families of the two elves.

&gt; Ron says "so that's a house elf?" which suggests he's never seen before. That seems unlikely doesn't it? I know the weasleys don't have one but surely a friend or family member of theirs does. 

House-elves seem to be owned mostly by upper-class families, so I think it could be plausible.

&gt; Libertarians have refused to identify specific free market restrictions that impede equality, which means there's nothing to measure. How do you proclaim statistical evidence if there's nothing to measure?

Wrong. There is something to measure: economic freedom. Economic freedom is the extent to which you can pursue economic activity without interference from government, as long as your actions don't violate the identical rights of others... this is Libertarianism 101. However, I'll get to this near the end of my post.

&gt;As opposed to a qualitative horoscope style "you will have a very economic freedom day" level analysis.

You missed what I was getting at... the statement "quantified numerically" is redundant because the word quantified implies that it is done so numerically.

&gt;"Economic freedom" is very, very vague.

No it isn't. It's been defined and measured. As I said earlier, I'll get to this near the end of my post. If anything you're exhibiting traits of the Dunning-Kruger effect. 

&gt;For instance, does it include the freedom for black people to buy lunch at Woolworth's (positive freedom), or does it mean the freedom for Woolworth's to hang a sign saying "White diners only" without fear of government intervention (Negative freedom)?

&gt;These are two perfectly valid ideas of freedom that are mutually exclusive, but libertarians promote negative freedom, while equality requires positive freedom.

&gt;So you can claim "Libertarians economics promote freedom" and "freedom promotes equality," and both statements taken individuality would be true. But the conclusion of "Therefore, libertarian economics promotes equality" would be wrong, because you're using two mutually exclusive definitions as if they were the same.

Check out the book The Economics of Discrimination by Dr. Gary Becker. Becker won the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work in topics such as discrimination. In Becker's book, he presents the argument that free markets, through the profit maximizing incentive, are the best way to combat racism and bigotry. The reasoning is simple: bigotry, if practiced by employers, has a cost. The best, most greed-driven profit maximizers will have no demand for this sort of strange, cost-imposing behavior. In a competitive market, we can expect that this behavior would lead directly to bankruptcy, and rightly so. Free markets provide the profit incentive for a color-blind society.

This is because actions have consequences. In a libertarian society however, the consequences will not come from the government. They will come from the market. Refusal to serve or hire someone based on arbitrary grounds will cost you the initial sale and repeat business. There is a common rule of thumb that is often seen and taught in business classes; the 80/20 rule. 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers. By driving away customers you're *willingly* giving your competition what otherwise would be *your* business. Look at African-Americans post-slavery... [Research by economist Dr. Robert Margo](https://www.nber.org/authors/robert_margo) (as well as others), has shown that discrimination leads to negative externalities for the group discriminated, which leads to market failure and inefficiencies. There is no room for bigotry, racism, sexism or homophobia in a competitive society.

However, if it is mandated by the government that you are forced to serve everyone, you are more or less putting a business that supports bigotry on life support. By legally requiring that they make the sale. However, this does nothing to stop bigotry. There is nothing forcing the waiters (in the Woolworth's example) from being horrible people to their customers they wish not to serve. The could spit on the food, under cook it, or just be rude.

&gt;Things you can quantify: "Number of states that ban segregated lunch counters."

Yes. That can be quantified.

&gt;Things you cannot quantify: "What is freedom?" Because again, freedom can mean just about anything.

That's why freedom is defined in terms of "economic freedom" something that can be measured numerically.

&gt;Show me the specific restrictions that correlate with equality

There are numerous market restrictions that impede on economic equality. For example some countries may have restrictions on the following:

&gt;&gt;* Business Freedom: Business freedom is a quantitative measure of the ability to start, operate, and close a business that represents the overall burden of regulation as well as the efficiency of government in the regulatory process.

&gt;&gt;* Trade Freedom: Trade freedom is a composite measure of the absence of tariff and non-tariff barriers that affect imports and exports of goods and services. Different imports entering a country can, and often do, face different tariffs.
 
&gt;&gt;* Monetary Freedom: Monetary freedom combines a measure of price stability with an assessment of price controls. Both inflation and price controls distort market activity. Price stability without microeconomic intervention is the ideal state for the free market.

&gt;&gt;* Government Size/Spending: This component considers the level of government expenditures as a percentage of GDP. Government expenditures, including consumption and transfers, account for the entire score.

&gt;&gt;* Fiscal Freedom: Fiscal freedom is a measure of the tax burden imposed by government.

&gt;&gt;* Property Rights: The property rights component is an assessment of the ability of individuals to accumulate private property, secured by clear laws that are fully enforced by the state.

&gt;&gt;* Investment Freedom: In an economically free country, there would be no constraints on the flow of investment capital. Individuals and firms would be allowed to move their resources into and out of specific activities internally and across the country’s borders without restriction.

&gt;&gt;* Financial Freedom: Financial freedom is a measure of banking efficiency as well as a measure of independence from government control and interference in the financial sector.

&gt;&gt;* Freedom from Corruption: Corruption erodes economic freedom by introducing insecurity and uncertainty into economic relationships. The higher the level of corruption, the lower the level of overall economic freedom and the lower a country’s score.

&gt;&gt;* Labor Freedom: The labor freedom component is a quantitative measure that looks into aspects of the legal and regulatory framework of a country’s labor market.

These restrictions correlate directly with economic freedom. But how does economic freedom correlate with positive equality? As I discussed earlier racism and sexism as well as other forms of bigotry are bad for the economy. The free market separates economic efficiency from irrelevant characteristics. For example, the purchaser of bread does not know whether it was made from wheat grown by a Caucasian, African-American, or Hispanic. In consequence, the producer of wheat is in a position to use resources as effectively as he can, regardless of what the attitudes of the community may be toward the color, the religion, or other characteristics of the people he hires. Furthermore, and perhaps more important, there is an economic incentive in a free market to separate economic efficiency from other characteristics of the individual. A businessman or an entrepreneur who expresses preferences in his business activities that are not related to productive efficiency is at a disadvantage compared to other individuals who do not. Such an individual is in effect imposing higher costs on himself than are other individuals who do not have such preferences. Hence, in a free market they will tend to drive him out.

But like I said earlier, government mandated policy will essentially put an otherwise inefficient, bigoted business on life support. Not to mention that government policy does nothing to change the hearts and minds of the ignorant. Bigotry will exist regardless of government intervention. It's simply "feel good" policy.

&gt;I'd be happy to answer that question.

Now about that answer... However, I have a sneaking suspicion you actually *don't have an answer*... you were expecting me to be the one without an answer.

Now you have the option... are you going to man up and answer my question... ignore me... or are you going to move the goal posts (and attempt to justify why you *aren't* moving the goal posts.)

Your move.

As long as she has that power granted to her by the state, your relationship will never be equal, regardless of how "sweet, innocent and docile" she appears to be (female game).

Ok, I'm a little late to the party, but I will provide you with irrifutable evidence that your vote is less than worthless (its actually harmful, as it deludes you into thinking you have choice, while giving credibility to a system that has none) and you should immediately stop wasting your time voting.  INSTEAD I advocate for change through organization and action OUTSIDE of the current voting structure (unless changes are made to it). 



The following are in no particular order, and are all heavily linked together, but I have separated them for ease of argument.  I am here referring to national politics, but local politics follow a (sadly) similar trend.  However on a local level occasionally change is possible, and I still believe the occasional vote in a local collection isn't a bad thing (unlike in a national election).  I will be speaking in generalities here, there are of course exceptions, but they are just that, and tend to prove the rule. 



1.)  There is no one decent to vote for.
This is a huge issue.  Due to the constraints of our system the people who end up on the ballet are generally not worth a vote.  They tend to be from a far wealthier class than most will ever be in (http://spectator.org/articles/39326/americas-ruling-class-and-perils-revolution), and their interests do NOT coincide with yours very often.  On top of that, with party politics even if they do, they often end up having to vote the way their party would like, invalidating their ability to represent their constituents.  However it is difficult to find out what most candidates even stand for anymore, which brings us to our second point.



2.)  Issues are rarely debated, fights and elections are rarely about policy.  When they are, it is often of a superficial nature.  There are many more systemic reasons for this, one of which is my third point, the media.



3.)  The media in the US are 100% crucial to winning elections, but are owned by a small group of very powerful companies with their own agenda (which will not line up with yours).  This means that it is almost guaranteed that a candidate who DOESN'T (at least privately) agree to these corporations/individuals demands, will not get elected: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership

http://worldtruth.tv/11-tactics-used-by-the-mainstream-media-to-manufacture-consent-for-the-oligarchy-2/








https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_model
This brings us neatly to our fourth point.



4.)  America is an oligarchy (or something similar like a plutarchy) where money is speech, wealth is extremely concentrated, elections are extremely expensive (and the candidate with the most money is the most likely to win:http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/04/think-money-doesnt-matter-in-elections-this-chart-says-youre-wrong/), lobbies are more prevalent than ever,  and votes are bought and sold all the time (http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-u-s-elections-bi-partisan-vote-buying-corporate-pr-campaigns-deja-vu-all-over-again/5412293).  The US has some of the worst inequality it has ever known, and in fact the world has ever known.  With that comes obvious (if unpleasant) consequences in a society where wealth is power.  This is quite obvious: http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 and while the implications are vast and terrible, in terms of elections it renders your vote absolutely meaningless.  You must have vast resources to even think about winning an election, and the only way to get that is to promise and deliver for your wealthy patrons (owners).



BONUS ROUND.)  There is massive vote-rigging and gerrymandering that further invalidates your vote as a means of expression, choice, political participation, and influence.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1thcO_olHas&amp;sns=fb


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering







So to sum up, every time you vote, you are actually doing harm as proven above.  You are lending legitimacy to a completely broken system, and taking time and resources (small perhaps but it counts) away from what could be other useful activities, political or otherwise. 




Although you didn't ask, there are some very simple things that could fix the system (if they just magically happened, they wont get passed our current completely corrupt government).  The following is just a very small set of examples as to how our electoral system might be redeemed (although I'm not saying that it is a particularly good idea, just that it is very easy to plug the wholes we have if those in power were actually interested in doing so, which they are provably not).  Limiting campaign money to a government stipend that comes from taxes, all parties get equal amounts and to get said stipend, all you need is 5-10% of the vote in a regional election.  Political speech from parties could be heavily regulated (ie. fact checked, with some sort of system for dealing with widely incorrect statements etc.).  Debates could be on issues submitted and moderated by the public, and the debates themselves would be proctored strictly to remain on issue.  Media would have to give equal time and attention to all parties that meet the stipend requirements. etc.  There are so very many ways that ways to move forward as a nation and voting in national elections isn't one of them.

From your comments here:  he lives at home, has no online presence, won't date people at work, won't go to the gym, can't drive, won't do long distance, is possibly on welfare, and only winds up places meeting taken people in their 30s.

His good qualities are that he's nice, employed, and not hideous.

I don't count your "doesn't see women as sex objects" and "while other people were looking at models, he was reading the times" as good things.  It's one thing (a good thing) to treat women with respect and not see them *only* as objects of lust; it's another thing to mentally divorce women from sex at all.  I don't know if you're attempting to be overly careful in your description but he sounds a bit prudish.

He's got to put himself in situations where there are single women his own age who share his interests.  Your description is a little too vague to really say what sorts of situations or what interests, but clubs, meetings, volunteer work, classes.  Asking friends is good, but point-blank asking can be rude; normally you'd only ask that of very close friends, otherwise you go to or host get-togethers where friends are free to invite friends.  With his AS dating at work may actually be a good thing; work dating can get messy.  He does, as others have said, have to step outside of his comfort zone, and while I hate (hatehatehate so much) agreeing one tiny iota with any redpiller, being nice isn't enough by itself to interest very many people with the situation he's in.  He's got a lot of things stacked against him, and whether that's fair, right, or not, it's something he's going to have to deal with, and dealing with it means either overcoming his hangups about things (facebook, gyms) or compensating by having plans to "fix" things (living at home, no driving.)

It has been extensively studied. Social mobility is much lower in countries with high income inequality such as the UK or the US. Which is amusing, given that most of the anti-redistribution talking points are about a fabled "meritocracy" where poor people are willing to work harder to move upwards if they don't get taxed...which we see in practice is complete horseshit. 


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility
&gt;Studies have also found "a clear negative relationship" between income inequality and intergenerational mobility.[13] Countries with low levels of inequality such as Denmark, Norway and Finland had some of the greatest mobility, while the two countries with the high level of inequality -- Chile and Brazil—had some of the lowest mobility.

The thing about respecting people's beliefs is that well, it's ultimately based on what society accepts. If someone says that he/she believes blacks and whites shouldn't marry in the US today, well the vast majority of people would laugh in his face, and any business that denied an interracial couple service would face penalties. Of course I don't think they should be thrown in jail for simply having that belief but I do think that same standard of societal acceptance of interracial relationships should stand for gay relationships as well. I mean frankly the only reason why it's not is that because people who didn't like gay people were the ones writing the Bible and if it had been people who liked gay people then this shit would have never happened. 

Forgive me if I may sound a bit hyperbolic or something, but sometimes at a fundamental level, I think of my own position in relation to the Jews. The Jews were given shit for centuries, the 20th probably being the worst, and because of it eventually they created their own state. They created their own state, and most of them defend it even when it does all sort of questionable shit, because they can't feel safe almost anywhere else. LGBT people are in a similar position, and I will say that of course even among us there are a lot ranges of opinions on stuff, in many cases dependent on where and how we grew up, but for at least some us we are in the same boat. Our safety is at the end of the day dependent on those around us and whether they like us or not, and through forces beyond our control can change. Society is growing more tolerant, and that's a great thing, but at the end of the day as long as homophobia is allowed to persist, it can always come back. I mean we are 50 years past the Civil Rights movement, but there is still at least the perception among some that black people are being murdered by police with impunity due to the color of their skin and that racism against blacks is getting worst, we are 70 years past the holocaust and yet Jews increasingly feel unsafe in Europe then they have in past decades. 

I mean, you say the LGBT community should turn the other cheek, but there is a question of balance here. For example in 2013, LGBT, which make up around 2-5% of the population suffered over 1300 hate crimes according to the FBI, while Christians who make up the vast majority of the population in total had about 120 incidents with protestants, who are also the majority, being at only around 30 incidents. I mean, LGBT people had in the past 50 years been on numerous occasions murdered, driven to suicide, dragged into mental institutions, beaten, have lost their jobs, their families, have been denied the chance to marry, to have kids, to be able to live their lives in the same peace that straight people have, and the very type of people who were most active in those crimes are now saying we should turn the other cheek in our apparent arrogance to ask that we be treated like everybody else. Frankly treating us as equals, after everything that has happened, is the least they could do and given everything that has happened, the fact that we are not exerting any real pound of flesh from all the shit that has happened should be enough.

I do understand what you are saying, and I apologize if I got rambleish in this whole thing, but, at the end of the day you have to understand, this isn't just a matter of beliefs. Homophobia physically hurts people, it kills people either through being gay bashed or through suicide because your loved ones think of you as something dirty or disgusting. It's also something that has no use, no value of society and only exists now because it has in the past and has no inherent permanence to it, and frankly when you tolerate it, you tolerate the destruction that is born of it. I don't advocate anything more extreme in this instance that business shouldn't be allowed to discriminate through sexual orientation, and I ask you why is that such a hard thing to accept.

(A) Bills, Bills, Bills came out way before Independent Women. (B) If you had actually listened to Bills, Bills, Bills and understood the cultural context behind it, you wouldn't need to ask this question. That song is not about her being dependent on a man or being a gold digger. It's a song where they are talking about a man who is basically taking advantage of her, using her cell phone, borrowing her car whenever. The chorus of the song that you referenced is them saying that they are not going to take the mooching anymore. Basically, if you want to be a lazy moocher, then we aren't going to be together anymore, but if you want to contribute something to this relationship, then maybe we can be together. It's a situation that I'm sure a lot of black women can relate to.
In summary, the reason more people don't 'call her on it' is because there is nothing to be called on. Not to mention the fact that she didn't make any of those songs by herself. Destiny's Child made those songs.

What are drugs? What is bad? These things are meaningless without context. We certainly cannot make the blanket statement that all drugs are bad; so can we say that some drugs are bad? Well, maybe. But bad in relation to what? To your health? Sure. To your relationships? Perhaps. To your ability to function, to exist as a person-in-the-world? Sometimes. "Bad" needs a good; it all depends on what you value.

If you care about the people in your life, you will place them above your drug use. If using drugs interferes with your relationships, then, well, according to what you've made clear, that would be bad. 

So it's up to how you want to do it, but IMO always err on the side of caution and responsible use.

[YouTube - The Myth of Race, debunked in 3 minutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnfKgffCZ7U)

If you can think of a few black men you are attracted to then obviously you aren't only attracted to whites.

The reason you can only think of a few is because you probably don't have a lot of attractive black men in your social circle.

To use your limited experience of black people to then extrapolate out to say "I only like white men" is racist.

Racism doesn't just have to be "thinking one race is better than another." You can have the belief that all races are equal but still be a racist, or act in racist ways. [Listen to this 1 minute long bit of this TED talk on the topic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ruIuwb8vw#t=234)

I'm not saying it's not ok to prefer a particular type of person over another, but it is racist to just rule out an entire group of people simply because of the colour of their skin. I mean isn't that exactly what racism is in every other scenario? There's no biological reason why you wouldn't be able to find someone with different geographical heritage attractive, because there's not really any such thing as race on the biological level, it's purely a sociological construct. There is only one race- the human race.

It's a big punch in the gut when you get betrayed like she did with her ex and it may just not be something she cares to have happen again....I've seen several instances where everything is fine and dandy with shared accounts until the relationship gets rocky for whatever reason...and all it takes is one person to go at the money to get back at the other person for whatever reason...and it sucks to be on the screwed over side of that situation. 

Personally, I don't share accounts, account access, info, anything...I don't even like the idea of a cosigner on something...my SO doesn't even know how much I have in any of my accounts...and I don't have any idea how much he has, but it works...for US. I've been burned with it before and would rather just leave that aspect out of my relationships and figure it out some other way because it's a headache I just don't care to deal with...and it isn't for lack of trust.

A little back story to all of this: When my mom finally decided to leave my dad, she had a savings account that was ONLY her money that she had been saving since she was a teen. It was roughly 10k. When she left, he drained the account, blew the money, and left her broke. He let the house they bought together to go into foreclosure to wreck her credit (his as well, but he did it out of spite and anger). Her life savings was gone because he chose to be a dick and she had given access. It happens, unfortunately. 

My sister was married. She earned decent money, had a decent job, did well for herself. She bought a house (in her name only) but had joint accounts with her hubby. Her hubby was literally white trash, so was his family. He drained her accounts. He left her with a massive amount of debt. She agreed to cosign on things, she agreed on joint accounts because "that's how spouses are supposed to do things and trust one another". She got burned, unfortunately. 

I had two accounts, checking and savings, that were created when I was a minor (checking was created at 15 or 16, savings was created when I was only a few years old to hold xmas and bday money) and required a parent to be on the account as well. It was setup to where I couldn't withdraw anything I put in there (on the savings account) without my mom's permission, but she could without mine (bs...just saying). My mom and I hit a rocky patch when I was almost 20. She assumed I was on drugs (I wasn't, she wouldn't even let me get a test to prove it), we argued, and she kicked me out. I'll also add, I had a car that I had paid for everything on but she was a cosigner on the loan (again, she never put a single penny toward the car). When she kicked me out, I was left homeless, she drained my savings and checking accounts, and took the car (claiming I didn't make the latest payment, which I had but it hadn't posted at the time and she assumed I was screwing her over)...I also lost my job of almost 5 years. When I went to get money for even a hotel room, they gave me 63 cents. That's all I had and the clothes on my back. I got burned. And I never ever want to be in that type of situation again. 

Now, I own my car and my mom's name is removed from the title. I have also bought a house so I wouldn't be able to get kicked out...only my name is on the title. No one has access to my bank accounts and no one knows how much money I do or do not have. My SO moved in with me a few months ago but we had the discussion about finances early on in the relationship. He didn't care to have shared accounts or access to one another accounts, although he hadn't been burned like I had. House is in my name and so are the bills. He gives me cash or a check for his "rent" to cover things and he pays for a lot of us going out (though I pay for some as well). 

There have been times where he has borrowed money from me for something here and there but always pays me back (it's usually because he wants to pay cash to pay his parents back for something). He doesn't pay me back? He doesn't get more. Period. He's never failed to pay me back so I trust him with loaning him money here and there and feel more comfortable with larger amounts, but I know he is responsible with his spending.

Every couple's financial situations/arrangements are going to be different to suit their needs. Some may share everything or just have one account, some may not share anything at all...some may have separate accounts with a joint one to transfer their portion of bills to....all of those are perfectly fine. And loaning money in a tight spot like a bank error (as you mentioned), isn't bad.

But. If she insists on everything being separate but gets to dip into your funds and she doesn't do very well with managing her money or would flip over having that much sitting in her account, then I would be careful. 

Personally, I would only give enough to get her past the error (and she returns it after the error is fixed) and forget the buffer until she learns better money skills because it could easily disappear and nothing beneficial has been learned from it. She needs to learn what the point of the buffer is, how to use it, how to build it, etc. otherwise your effort will go to waste and potentially lead to some frustration in the relationship. Just giving the buffer to her before she learns self control and knows how to handle it won't lead to much good. 

Sorry for the insanely long post...it strikes a nerve when people say those who refuse to do shared accounts have serious trust issues and it is a relationship problem...because it can work with separate accounts and there can still be a massive amount of trust between two people even without the shared accounts...it is just represented in another way. 

Edit: Wanted to add, basically what I'm saying...teach her how to fish (manage her money) instead of just giving her the fish...it's better in the long run. 

And anyone hating on not sharing accounts, stop sippin dat haterade.

I've never dated yet, in a large part because I'm much more suited to being a girlfriend than a boyfriend, based on personality and relationship role preferences alone, let alone gender. I'm probably willing to date while part time, but I'd feel really weird doing so. But I'm not even part time yet, I'm probably not going to be until I start HRT. I'm currently in the "using a beard" stage, pun very much intended. Despite what intuition will tell you, not many lesbians want to date women that look like homeless men/the messiah.

Once I'm part time though, I'm probably going to tag along to bi events with my sister in the hopes of meeting someone. I've given up on OkCupid, I cannot convey charisma on an "about me" page. And the women in my area on there really aren't my type, as in one of the more feminine "girls who like girls" had been on T for a few months, and at least half the girls were pregnant/mothers. The only success I've had was a stunning girl who sent me a message wanting to fuck that night, a few days after I decided that I didn't ever want to have sex as a man because of the dysphoria.

I saw it as an essay on the author's experiences that was well-written and relatable.

I mean, the author fell in love with her best friend, that crashed and burned, and now seeing him getting married brought these memories and feelings back, which is completely normal.

And her doubts about settling for someone vs. waiting for the right person are also completely normal. 

And her putting all this in writing is also completely normal, I mean love and loss was one of the main themes (if not the main theme) in literature since the written word was invented, writers use writing to process emotions like that. 

So I don't understand where you guys see a problem with what she wrote?

Sure, it may not be your cup of tea, or you might roll your eyes at the title, or at the fact that a 25 year old is worried about being doomed to stay single forever, but she's just being honest about the way she feels, and I'm sure most of us have felt in a similar way at one point or another (losing the person you love, watch them find happiness with someone else, doubt your own choices, etc.), so what's the issue?

Also, a lot of comments here are harsh, but without a substance, people say that being criticised and accepting criticism is a part of maturing, but I don't see any constructive criticism so far, no one is going point by point with why they didn't like the essay, everyone's just saying "lady neclbeard! immature! disconnected from reality" etc., that's not criticism, that's insults without substance that are not constructive in any way.

You want to criticise the author? Great. But do it in a civilised and constructive manner.

P.S. I don't understand the "this is self-indulgent" part, it's an essay about personal experiences, it's supposed to be "self-indulgent", that's what this form of writing is about, it wasn't meant to be a general article about dating in one's 20s backed with scientific research and Match.com data.

P.P.S. Also, guys calm down about her not being on best terms with her ex-best friend, I assume the vagueness was intentional as not to air dirty laundry and hurt the ex-best friend, we don't know what went down between them, so it's not our place to to take sides.

When you're listed as bi and all of the "couples" on there message you asking for a three way/group relationship. No offense to people who are into that but me being attracted to more than one gender doesn't necessarily mean I want to bang everyone at the same time.

When I was 5 years old my 13yo (step)uncle molested me.  This went on for 3 years,  during which time my mom's cousin did the same thing.   These eye two very separate instances.   Needless to day I was exposed to sex at a very young age.   After that I was always aware of it and the effect it had on me.  I started developing breasts at 8yo and by the 6th grade was wearing a C cup already.   This didn't help.  Over the next couple years I expanded my sexual horizons by doing pretty much everything under the sun except actual intercourse.  Then when I turned 15 my grandpa took me for a driving lesson and kept using "distractions" while driving as an excuse to feel me up.  I've always been sexualized by the men in my life and I've always been helpless to do anything about it.   I'm 33 now and spent quite a few years sexual abusing myself and allowing others to do the same to me.  I do believe that one reason I tend to be the dominant one in my relationships is because of all the hurt I went through.   I also believe the reason I was never able to date black men was because of my uncle.

I am pretty sure that won't be an issue.  Firstly because we have a non-profit school where most of the money goes to rent or supplies.  It's hard to feel swindled when no one got money from it.

Secondly, our full paid students are mostly upper class, white collar office workers.  They don't really have problems with money.  What they do have are problems coming to class often enough to become exceptional or exercising enough on their own time.  Training with young, fit, competent people adds immeasurable value to their workout.

Lastly, we build relationships that last years at a time.  I am a student of 8 years, who still pays full dues and I suggested the program after running it by all of our senior students.

By the info you've given, you are almost certainly not fat.  125 pounds is pretty much the middle of a healthy weight range for a 5' 4" woman.

I looked briefly at your profile, and didn't see any pictures that were useful for evaluating your figure.  Your weight is normal, but the pics answer questions like "Are you in shape, or a bit soft around the edges?"  If you are pear shaped with a slim waist, you are both more attractive and at lower risk for health troubles than someone with mostly belly fat, even if it's just 10-15 pounds.

Since belly fat is a big factor these days, you might want to add your waist measurement.  I can run some stats that evaluate whether you have 'too much fat' compared to your height and weight.

[I have written a guide to 'my take' on an AmIFat post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amifat/comments/374cbb/a_good_amifat_post_my_toowordy_overdetailed_take/)  My apologies for the wall of text, but I would encourage you to get together good pics, and I (and others) can give you a good rate in return.

I look forward to hearing what you think is 'fat' about you, and giving you an honest opinion.

Here's a cold hard fact for you:  When it comes to homicides, statistically speaking most people are killed by members of their own race.  Stop trying to push a bullshit narrative that black on black violence is some sort of anomaly and that other races do not in fact do the same thing that you're pretending is unique to the black community.

Snippet from a relevant, and sourced, [article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/15/the-trayvon-martin-killing-and-the-myth-of-black-on-black-crime.html):

&gt;But there’s a huge problem with attempt to shift the conversation: There’s no such thing as “black-on-black” crime. Yes, from 1976 to 2005, 94 percent of black victims were killed by black offenders, but that racial exclusivity was also true for white victims of violent crime—86 percent were killed by white offenders. Indeed, for the large majority of crimes, you’ll find that victims and offenders share a racial identity, or have some prior relationship to each other.

&gt;What Shapiro and others miss about crime, in general, is that it’s driven by opportunism and proximity; If African-Americans are more likely to be robbed, or injured, or killed by other African-Americans, it’s because they tend to live in the same neighborhoods as each other.

Would you like to reject and argue these facts?  Do you have any evidence that the problem you're decrying as unique to black culture is in fact unique to black culture, or am I about to read you admit that whites have the same severe problem that blacks do with regards to whites explicitly targeting and massacring their own?  HINT: That's the wrong way to interpret the statistics, and hopefully turning the "logic" around will show you how ridiculous it sounds.

There is a very simple and non-racist explanation for these statistics, and the article goes into those details.

If someone is unqualified for a job, they won't get it. I'd like to say if someone is outclasses someone else they'd get the job but it's up to the employers discretion and being overqualified is a thing. I don't think you realize that affirmative action isn't a hard and fast rule, it isn't a magic pass for a job and affects anyone who's a minority in a major workplace not just blacks.

I never said there isn't a valid argument against affirmative action, however expecting an anecdote to sway anyone or prove anything is stupid, if you're going to go against it then pull up facts and figures rather than your drinking buddies work story. I'm not here to debate affirmative action I'm here to point out the hypocrisy in the sub and how it's validating Tumblrian's bullshit.

&gt;However, the fact that there are poor people in need of charity doesn't mean that my employer may pay me less for my labor because he intends on giving to charity. 

Ah okay I just got confused with the context as I feel people too often mix the employer-employee and the state-citizen relationship. 

I don't think that a business should "tax" its employees in such a way as that wasn't what I was suggesting. I thought this was more about the citizen-state relationship.

&gt;To say you only have the right to have your needs met is wrong. You have the right to be paid for what your services are worth, which must be at least enough for you to live on.

This is also the point I was trying to make.

As a non-white dude, all I can say is that the vast majority of white women I've met have been, either subconsciously or consciously, extremely racist against any non-white dudes. 


Obviously not openly, but they are very against relationships with non-white guys. I've had some close friends (white women) even admit to me that white women just find it hard to be sexually attracted to non-white guys.

The only non-white guys that seem to get a pass here are black guys, though that is probably due to the connotations/taboo associated with black guys (always 'bigger' etc etc).


But yea, any other color of guy and its basically a crapshoot.



Not that I'm worried, there are PLENTY of non-white women out there who can't seem to get enough of us non-white guys (maximum &lt;3 to all you beauties out there), but still. All I'm saying is that this whole issue is much more specific to white women, rather than women in general, and it should be noted as such.


Almost all other women of other races don't seem to have this issue, even in the slightest. In fact, as a non-white guy who has lives in the western world, its really only when I'm with my non-white gfs that I truly stop sensing the racism.


Source: I've dated almost every nationality/race/skintone under the sun. 


Now obviously this isn't ALL white women. But for the vast majority this holds true for certain.

Once upon a time, historically, being large was considered generally attractive.

Admittedly, this was before the health risks of obesity were really known; and at the time, being large merely meant that you were wealthy enough to be able to afford more food than most people; nonetheless, there was a time when such an idea was considered normal and commonplace...
