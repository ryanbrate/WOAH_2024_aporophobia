This is just lovely, and I hope these disadvantaged youth get the help they need. But I have to say, I am seeing plenty of disadvantaged white youth that don't get the support they need. I am tired of it being about an ethnicity. It needs to be about income and the disadvantaged regardless of race. 

Where I live it is obvious that the ethnicity is white. Oh, but whites are privileged right? Not. White uneducated are less likely to get a job than the other supposedly discriminated races around here. 

Of course drugs are rampant and take down a lot since all of our jobs have been outsourced to foreign countries. When I was 18 I could quit a job one day and have a new one the next. I remember Ross Perot and his giant sucking sound. How true. Now we have so many unemployed that it is practically impossible to get a job, and btw how do you apply? The days of putting in a physical application are gone, Internet all the way baby, that way you never have to look someone in the face. You knock all the legs out from someone and what do they do? 

We have many options, like heroin. Totally takes the place of a job or any aspirations of such. So much easier to give them that and then send them to state facilities. They make all kinds of things for 75 cents a day. You just wouldn't believe who takes advantage of that. Just take a look   http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/21694-shocking-facts-about-americas-for-profit-prison-industry#

Face it, white kids are not going to have the future that their parents aspired to. If white kids don't, what do you think any other kid will have?  When you see 150 IT workers outsourced to India in California, and our government will not stop the H1B visa jobs? They have to train their displacements while signing agreement not to discuss it or they will lose their jobs, (unemployment benefits) lol.  

It doesn't matter what your race is, you are being pulled down to the Viet Nam level on wages. Try living or raising a family on that. But of course we don't have inflation, unless you count fuel and food, but those aren't measured. 

The main inflation factors are food and energy cost, and THEY AREN'T MEASURED in the national index. OMG. Anybody notice when Campbell's soup went up a dollar a can? Anybody notice when bread is at 3 a loaf? Anybody notice when vegs went from 50 cent to 1 a can? don't even talk about baby formula or diapers. Anybody notice when gas goes up by 10 cent one day and another 10 cent the next? But that is not factored. This is NC which is vaguely reasonable. 

This is what happens when our government is run by money and corporations.  If anyone can refute this, have at it. Any thing said here is solely of my own thoughts and experience. 

Bring down the corporate governance. CFR, World Bank, IMF, they are all globalist agenda along with many more. They want to equalize the world, which if you are American 
isn't such a good thing. Also, oppose the TPP and the TIPP and all other trade deals that seek to give our governance to a corporate agenda. They are destroying countries and economies.  

We don't need a growing economy. We need a sustainable economy. We need the commons. We need to take back the corporations power to destroy our world and exploit our resources. We need to exert our power to destroy theirs. If we don't they will decimate the world. Total collapse which we are already staring in the face with climate change. What do you want for your grand children? 

Sorry for the rant. Guess I just needed to get it off my chest.

This gave me a better appreciation for when friends or family treat me to meals.  To this day I can never turn away someone hungry.  I had a pretty abusive ex once.  She was a heroin user.  A short time after we spilt she was homeless.  She came to my home after being without food for a couple days.  The bitter person in me wanted to turn her away, but because of stories like ours I couldn't.  I fed her well. She got showered and we washed her clothes.  I took her to the airport the next day and put her in a plane home.  She's much better now, but hungry people are my weak point now.

&gt;The unemployed heroin addict on methadone living in a basement apartment had been homeless alcoholic before converting to Islam.

He's not just a bit *nutty*, he's literally *Nuttall*. That's his name. I'm sure there's a joke in there... somewhere.

edit.: It's obvious the RCMP people insistently solicited a tangible terrorism action plan from the guy:

&gt;“What we were doing was a long investigation — we were spending a lot of taxpayers’ money there,” he conceded. “We had to see if this guy is for real or not. Do we stop it **or do we keep on going to check … is he going to do it?**”  

&gt;But the mercurial Nuttall often talked nonsense.  

&gt;For instance, **pressed to come up with a plausible plan**, Nuttall described [several goofy scenarios]
 and when the Mountie found out, **he scolded Nuttall** as if he were a recalcitrant child.

&gt;“My help is still there,” the officer said during the May 10 meeting, **"but I need something that can be done."**

&gt;“I want to not hurt innocent people, I don’t want to blow myself up but I want to do as much damage to their infrastructure from within. **OK, I don’t know how to do that, I don’t have any better ideas.**”

&gt;Sandford wondered if it all suggested Nuttall wasn’t serious.

&gt;“I don’t think so,” the officer insisted.

&gt;“**I spent time with Mr. Nuttall and that wasn’t the message I was getting.** I spent time with Mr. Nuttall, I spent too much time with him. … There was time when I wanted to take time off, **I wanted to do other projects instead of doing that one** because it was too much.”

&gt;The trial continues.



Well. Let's just say; That article left me with the impression the RCMP guy just wanted to nail Nuttall and be done with it. They were spending "a lot of taxpayer's money there". He struggled, under solicitation, to come up with a tangible plan. That gives me reason to believe that man would not have done any of it on his own.

Who knows? The guy who was so tired of Nuttall's "*confused versions of world history, strange conspiracy theories, his understanding of Reaganomics or the deep inspiration he found in Rambo III.*" that he felt the need to MAKE IT happen?

I think it's a very, very sad affair.

Apparently we're all responsible for our siblings now, even if they (like most homeless addicts) don't want your help or to be a burden.

If you, like Jonathan O'Brien, are married with young children, then it is your responsibility to take in any of your relatives who are recovering heroin addicts - by force if necessary.

The state abdicates its responsibility.

On heroin and homeless in his own pile of shit. Who wouldn't want to be there instead of with the crazy ex that was simply incompatible from so far away and on multiple dimensions in the first place? Of course, victimize the creep. Make him feel even more guilty about his false excitement. Film another perspective, fast-forward into what the angel becomes in the background of a sinister gathering of her equals. Nothing more, nothing less; just a boozed-up, honest, knowingly manipulative guy trying to degrade the gal into absolute dust with his partners at his side. Just a simple U-Turn, a healthy reminder not to get in too deep. Paradise. Right?

The fine wasn't for being drunk, it was for staying the night at this private "facility".  It has no affiliation with the state other than that the police drop you off there.  There were people in there voluntarily kicking heroin.  There were other people, like me, who were drunk and committed no crime.  There were homeless people.  I could tell, though, that they were looking for people who seemed they would and could pay the bill before they left.  Lots of decently dressed people.  

The penalty for not paying the fine is that it will show up on your credit report, because the organization is private.  Pretty fucked up.  I mean, what kind of mafioso says, "Pay the bill now, it's $190.  Pay it tomorrow and it's $350.".

Linden, NJ. An abounded house on wood ave full of homeless, broken people. About 6-7 guys, Polish &amp; Russian. 

We heard of them from friends who live in the area, some of the homeless guys would work construction and other various jobs when someone needed extra help.

My father owns a construction business as well, and this is where the story begins.

My father didnt have any people working for him at the time, maybe one extra worker at random times. So he decided to stop by the house, knock and ask if anyone is interested to do some roofing/siding job.

He got about 4 guys. 

Since that day he would pick them up every day.  One was a heroin addiction victim, his name was Radek. The rest were alcoholics.
1. Tomek (Blacha aka Steel) (brother of kris)
2. Kris (Cranberry) (got caught drinking cranberry juice with vodka at work, so we nicknamed him cranberry.
3. Pilsudzki (Pilsudzki) Polish Statesman

As the relationship grew, they had their bad and good times. Sometimes some of them were ass drunk in the morning or high on heroin. But my father kept taking them when they were able to work.

Over time I realized that its not only because he wants them to work for him, but also because he wanted to help them get out of that life and get back to normal.

Long story short.

They were making $100 a day each, but still lived in the abounded house. ($2000 all together) this started in 2013. 

But as soon as they got the money it was gone like nothing. So my father started giving them partially, acting like a bank for them. Only when they need it. Because they would spend it on alcohol or drugs which all ruined them the next day.

Radek became my fathers right hand man. Like a manager, he made sure the guys will be up and ready sober the next day. A really great guy. Thus having a heroin problem, his habit was starting to change over time. He would take less and weaker doses to slowly get out of it. (Theres no point of getting him to rehab as he wouldnt stay) Progress was there, he was getting better. 

Radek lost his wife, child and his contracting business few years back due to his "friend" that introduced him onto heroin. From there his world shattered. Thus becoming homeless. 

It was christmas week of 2013, my father was building a shed our backyard. He took the whole crew to build it and I helped as well. When lunch time hit the clock, we all went inside and my father made us lunch. As we're all eating and joking around, Radeks face wasnt as happy as always. We all felt it and seen it. Something was wrong... So i asked, whats wrong. Everyone got quiet and Radek said that he was sad, disappointed how his life turned out to be. It hit all of us those words and we Litterly felt bad. But we made him feel better by bringing his mood up with positive talk and got back to work. I even took some pictures of us all working that day.

What happened next morning was heart braking. We get a phone call from kris saying Radek is dead, he overdosed. They dont know what to do, they are all scared. Radek was sitting on the floor dead with blood coming out his nose.

My father quickly called the police and went to the location.

Everyone was sitting outside of the house questioned by police etc. What happened was that one of the guys bought strong dose and his heart couldnt handle it anymore. 

Radek didnt give us any contact to his family in Poland or his wife in NJ that left him. My father took care of his body and found out all the contacts through days of non stop research. He informed the family in Poland (mother &amp; father) and his wife in NJ.
He made sure the wake happened and his body will be sent to his family in Poland and buried there. Paid for it all. 

Since then the whole house was closed down and everyone got on the street. My father quickly found an apartment for them near and told them "from now on you all living here and I will deduct the rent from what you earn per month"

The 3 guys are still living there but no longer working with my father as they dont want to change and caused problems for my father at work. Thus my father was giving them chances and taking care of them as kids (who are older than my father) they didnt stop drinking and had withdrawal seizures at work because he didnt let them drink anymore. It was too dangerous and my father lost his work place due to it. So he had to back off.

They work now occasionally with my fathers friends doing various kids of labor. 

I guess he did what he could. But he defenitly changed their life for better and gave them a chance when nobody did. 

I have some youtube videos of them enjoying time at our pool etc. They are pretty hilarious.

1999 I was in Goa and my visa ran out on the 28th December. Screw that, I'm not going to leave yet I was having too much fun, I'll see in the new year and then go to Bombay and get an extension so I can legally leave and go home. So on about the 5th of Jan I'm burned out from partying too much, doing way to many drugs and I'm running out of money. I take my last 2000 rupees (in 4 500 notes plus a bit of random change) and get my ass to a the nearest local bus stop. About to get on the bus and I check my pockets. Fuck, I'm somehow down 500 rupees already. I think back to the bus stop where there was one other guy waiting with me, who suddenly got up and left when I was stretching my legs. Ah well, I figure it must have fallen out of my pocket, he saw it and took it. Bit of a bummer but ultimately no biggie, still got money left to get food and a hotel. 

So I eventually get to Bombay after about 4 transfers and try to find a hotel. Sadly none of them would let you get a room without a valid visa. I beg and plead saying I am going to the police tomorrow to extend it, but they are all a bunch of bastards despite me offering to pay more. Truly odd in India that this was one time I couldn't bakshish my way out a situation. As I'm walking down a staircase having given up I see a family living on the stairwell. Fuck it, if they can do it, so can I. Later that night I come back, find an empty space between floors and bed down for probably the most uncomfortable night ever. Just me, the hard floor, my bag for a pillow and supreme heat. I must have slept a total of about 2 hours that night.

The next day I'm up nice and early for obvious reasons and hotfoot it across town to the police quarters in charge of extensions. As I get out of the taxi I'm accosted by a couple of Indian transvestites. A little freaked out I shrug them off, step over some homeless guys smoking heroin under a blanket and go into the building a bit weirded out. It takes about an hour of typical bureaucracy before I sit down at a table with an officer. After a few minutes of umming and ahhing he says "We have decided not to prosecute you", does a subtle cough and sticks out his hand. I give him 500 rupees (about £10 at the time) as its the smallest note I have. He says "This is too much". I reply, and this is no lie, "Sorry I don't have anything smaller. Buy the wife something nice." I can't believe I just said that but he smiles and pockets the cash. He duly stamps my visa and I'm on my merry way. I go back to a hotel, get a room and spend the next four days until my flight home smoking dope, snorting ketamine and wandering the streets in a drugged up daze.

I've also been trapped into a scam ~~poker~~ blackjack game when some guy invited me to meet his family in some random part of Pnomh Penh, luckily I was quite wary before hand and only took a small amount of money with me. Apparently I could have won around $17,000 before I managed to get away, silly me for bailing out, I could have been rich! I can provide more details if you want but that's the gist of it.

Tldr version: Old friend fell on hard times (homeless on heroin) and I let her and her daughter stay with me for a while trying to get clean.  She failed at that, decided to run off with some junky guy, I convinced her to leave the kid here until she was in a better place.  That was 3 years ago, we figure she's not coming back.

Nothing.  My mom has been there for me through some of the worst things a mother can see their child go through.  I was a heroin addict for 6-7 years, got a DUI while going to get heroin in my bosses car, was homeless for a couple years, unemployed, and when I was at the worst, she would cry herself to sleep every night, not knowing if I was alive or dead in a ditch somewhere.  She paid for me to attend an in-patient rehab in another state, which I completed, then as soon as I got back home went and got some dope.  During the worst of it she helped me get into a studio condo, so she knew I had a safe place, and I would sell drugs out of there, have all sorts of people at all hours, got many complaints from neighbors, had the cops there several times.  Once a guy climbed in my window and put me in a headlock trying to rob me, then he passed out, had the cops and an ambulance there.  Had a friend of mine overdose and had the cops and ambulance there for that.  Had my ex-gf overdose and die in my bathroom.  I got charged with felony tampering with evidence.  She paid over $10,000 in lawyer fees for me to get my sentence down to 3 years probation, where it would have been straight jail and I would have lost my job and career (I had a job much of the time, except for a couple years while homeless.)  After I found my ex dead, I quit heroin, and never touched it.  Since then, I've rebuilt my relationship with her and my stepdad, fully paid off the condo, bought and fully paid off (financed by her) a sweet car, met a wonderful girl, and gave my mom a daughter-in-law on my mom's birthday no less, and we just bought a house together.

My mom is a hell of a woman, and I owe her everything.

That's where it indeed gets complicated. Quite often there is a psychological factor at play as well... is the drug abuse cause of that or a consequence? Were they severely depressed and started drinking to numb their feelings? Or have they become addicted to alcohol for other reasons? And have they drunk so much that by now Korsakov Syndrom is at play as well?

As for the free heroin projects here, as far as I know they're on a very specific dosage and they need to get every fix at that project, so overdosing isn't an issue there. [This](http://www.joop.nl/politiek/detail/artikel/4530_cda_vvd_fail_omstreden_gratis_heroine_project_uiterst_succesvol/) is an older article about heroin projects in my country (looking back on 10 years of this project), maybe you can run it through a translator. It mentioned how it's not necessarily a tool to get them off the drug, but to enhance their overall quality of life. Side-effect is that crime rates caused by drug addicts have dropped.

That being said... we had pain killers in our office that the homeless people could ask for if they had a head ache of another discomfort. Often they'd tell me to only give them one or two pills, because they wouldn't want to be tempted to overdose. We ended up having a policy not to give out full packages, just to be sure. On the other hand, pain killers are fairly cheap so if someone had wanted to actually kill themselves that way, they could've quite easily have bought it themselves.

There aren't any easy answers I'm afraid. Which is why, if you want to make this a focus point of whatever study you choose, this is also so very interesting.

I live in a major city.  Two weeks ago I traveled to the mayor's office to personally propose a new policy that I hoped would help us all learn something new about ourselves and about our world - and perhaps inspire us to try to make things better.

I want the city to implement a policy where every year, all residents are required to find a picture of themselves as babies and to spend at least 30 minutes looking at those pictures.

Now it might seem like a strange and worthless idea at first, but hear me out.  Imagine your own face as a baby, if you even remember what you looked like.  If you can bring to mind a picture of yourself smiling, try that.  Take a moment now to hold that image in your head.

So small, so innocent - no baby has bad intentions.  Scientists have suggested that babies are inherently biased towards favoring cooperation and compassion.  Deep down we all are born wanting to help.  But bringing it back to your own baby picture - how far have you come from that little baby?  How much have you been through?

I don't think any parent imagines their baby growing up to suffer, yet for most of us we don't remain in the same kind of condition as those baby photos.  

Try it.

Anyway, I brought my proposal to the mayor's office.  Rather, I entered the building and was promptly asked to leave.  I had handwritten my proposed policy on a piece of cardboard, which on the back says "homeless - please help."  I was told not to approach the building again or face arrest.  Tonight I will sleep under the highway again, and tomorrow I will do what I can to try to track down more heroin.

The last time I saw my own baby picture it was before being evicted from my apartment.  

My parents thought I was innocent, pure, sweet, untouchable - at least for a while.

For a while all of our parents believed that about us. And for a while, it was true.

What happened?

This is very true. 

My niece is homeless, mostly by choice. 

When she was around 20 she developed a serious heroin addiction. My family did everything we could to make sure she could get clean. Once she was we realized there were some serious underlying issues. 

She started behaving oddly. She started to write strange, rambling poetry and dress incorrectly (e.g. wearing a sweater as a dress). At one point she disappeared for a few days and when she came home she started a very paranoid rant about how we were keeping her from her children (which didn't exist). She started brandishing weapons, not threatening us or hurting herself, just keeping them around. 

In an attempt to get her help we put her under a 72 hour psych hold. The doctor diagnosed her with "Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified." For a while she'd stay with family. But she's an adult and we couldn't/can't force her to do anything.

Occasionally we get phone calls or hear stories of where she is from her old friends. Right now she's living on the streets of San Diego after a small stint in jail for shoplifting. She refuses to live with anyone. My sister paid 3 months rent on an apartment for her and she still won't live there. She's sick but there's not much we can do.

I don't think I ever wished death on anybody - I think that I just said that I had mentioned to my parents that junkies are "parasites" (I don't totally remember the wording as I deleted the post - it contained more personal information that I'm willing to put out there). My parents aren't brain dead - they know about harm reduction techniques and when I said it they looked at me like I admitted to murder. I have a close family member who is a recovering coke addict - there's no way that saying one sentence would convince my parents that all junkies should die and to vote against harm reduction. I apologize if I came off as being hostile to you - that certainly was not my intent. Far before I even touched drugs I always sympathized with drug users and it makes me sad every time I see a homeless person clearing going through withdrawals. But I certainly have not been sneaking around talking about how all heroin users need to die, I'm unsure what may have given you that impression, and again I apologize if I came off as being a dick. 

I'd imagine a few of you have experienced similar - lately I just haven't been the person I used to be. I rarely lie and now I'm going to lie to the people I love the most just for some fucking white powder, plus now I'm being a dick to strangers for no reason. I'm not using heroin as an excuse for my behavior as that comes down to me and and the poor life choices I've made - but I just want to say it:   

Fuck heroin.

They're not places where unmarked cars pretend to be taxi's and can make you disappear forever in a matter of seconds, which is a legitimate thing especially near international airports situated throughout Asia.

Ever gone four-wheel driving near the Burmese/Myanmar - Thai border? Expect to get pulled over by children with AK47's and full bags of heroin, they'll load you right up for free and let you drive to customs at the border.

I grew up in a Philly suburb, and I worked and lived in the city for a long time too.  Now that I'm an adult and have traveled around the world, I can say with confidence that it is not one of the best cities in the country.  

What exactly do you think makes it so great; the high city wage tax, State run liquor stores, the murders, the heroin trade, the gangs, the rapes, the wealth disparity, the obvious segregation of neighborhoods, the rude and angry people, the crazed and often dangerous sports fans, the constant hit and runs, SEPTA, traffic, litter, crumbling properties, crumbling bridges, crumbling roads, mummers, Joey Vento, the massive homeless population, the shortage of EMTs, the sea of fat asses, acid rain, Kensington Ave, or Comcast?

If you really think this city is the "jawn", than you've either never been outside of it, or you never leave Center City.

I'd like you all to say hi to Skye. He likes to pretend like he's in the military (see below for his past claims on alternate accounts) and he usually claims to be Navy SEAL/Sniper?Corpsman/SWCC or a Marine Corps Sniper.

Those goat hoarders (lol) also like to grow poppy and provide 90 percent of the world's heroin (through Taliban war lords). So don't confuse a bucolic lifestyle with an innocent one. That being said, we had different tiers of targets while deployed. With the tier that held the farmers, we went out of our way to meet with and engage civilly. The farmers and goat hoarders only become threats if you destroy their livelihoods. The higher tiers are only known Taliban and al-Qaida or Chechnya freelancers. In my time with "the enemy" we freed several towns from those warlords. We increased the quality of life. I can't speak for the whole war. I know for certain mistakes were made. But for what I could control, or influence, we did our best to help. I'm sorry you feel the u.s. government is the enemy. I am doing what I can to change the climate of fear in America. I suggest everyone do the same. It's little acts of kindness to the homeless, or participating in elections for sheriff, that kind of thing. Stop blaming the president and congress. They don't do as much as you think. What's that saying they used to use, "Act locally, think globally" something like that? We fix our city governments and there corrupt police forces first. The rest will follow. End rant I guess.

You wouldn't even need to ride in the car.  Have the uber driver meet you at a starbucks and give him a locked briefcase with a kilogram of black tar heroin, or a kilo of sweet #4 china white, not that I know about such things. Pay then in cash with a nice tip, and tell them to deliver it to a drop off point.  You could be shipping out a kilo every 10 minutes, or 6 kilos/hour, or 48 kilos in an 8 hour day.  So, since a kilo of smack costs $2,600/kilo in Pakistan, you'd be moving 2600x48 = $124800 of H per day, if you only shipped 1 kilo per driver.  Not that I would know about such things.  But you wouldn't get busted because none of the drivers would ever know your real name.  This would work the same for taxis.  And the drivers would have plausible deniability so they couldn't get busted either.

edit:  an uber driver could be LE, so you'd want to pay a homeless person to hand off the briefcase to the driver, or to ride in the driverless car.  You could easily afford to pay a homeless person $200/day plus a clothing and food allowance for their effort.  They'd be making $1k/week and working under the table.  They wouldn't even be homeless after just one day of work.  I think I just solved the homeless problem.  How come Bill Gates or Bono haven't thought of this?

Oh yea!  Page 412 right?  (I always get it wrong haha)
  
I got court ordered in 2002 to go to meetings.  Hated it.  Never really "recovered" or relapsed, but I knew the idea of the program.  Then life took some turns and I went to a few rehabs.  Like 5 of them, but it was always the "it's just weed" or "it's just one drink" and what I really wanted was heroin, and I'd always go back.  
  
Eventually, I got really serious, and I got 6 months.  Sponsor.  Up to step 9.  And I had an amends go wildly wrong.  I also had a love go completely sour, and I just gave up.  
  
It was interesting, because I had made a lot of friends in NA/AA.  And I remember really giving up that time.  Like completely to the dope game, living breathing it.  A lot of really really bad stuff happened, and almost died, and I called a friend from NA who was, to my delite, STILL CLEAN, and he told me he'd help me out.  I was homeless and so tired.  Beat up.  
  
I came to his place and totally surrendered.  Just WHATEVER he asked, I did it.  Service work?  Ok.  Drive anyone to meetings?  Ok.  90 in 90?  Did 276 in 90.  I did panels every week, I worked with local hospitals to get a hotline established and literature in, which it never was.  I really went all in.  That's kinda my style haha..  
  
I got 9 months, and then when I was very ill I took a trazadone, and it became this whole ordeal that I'd relapsed (and I suppose by definition of not prescribed -- it is) and I was also feeling ego and cocky.  I got a girlfriend.  And then things unraveled.  
  
I think the beauty of the program that it can be what you make of it with some very simple truisms.  Like, the idea of acceptance is the basic premise of Zen Buddhism, or Stoic thought.  That idea of control goes way way back.  The Egyptians were carving it on stone 5,000 BC.  A very powerful but counter-intuitive idea.  
  
I have this big background in science and psych, cognitive behavioral science too, so the ego thing has always been of great interest to me.  And then the science behind the central nervous system.  That this "addiction" thing really does transcend not just chemicals but very basic human behavior.  I crossed some invisible line, and now I have to be very mindful of my ego, what feeling is calling for.  That before thinking, this automatic survival instinct is haywire, and I have to pause, and think, listen.  Kinda those ideas of pray meditate.  
  
I'm probably convoluted and filled with idealism, but it's this process that I've ironed out over years and years, and for the most part, I can say with some certainty that it kept me clean through some real hardships, and I was still happy about being clean.  
  
Curious, what about you?  How long have you been going at it?  What step are you on now?

&gt; [People who are sleeping in cardboard boxes in the street and slowly starving to death] choose to live that way. Most of them are funding massive heroin and/or crack addictions with the money they make. It isn't cheap.

&gt; But they decided to be drug addicts, and don't give enough of a shit to get help and get off of the streets.

&gt; There are plenty of homeless shelters they could use, too, but generally you can't be drunk or high when you go to them... so they choose to sleep on the sidewalk instead.

Unbelievable. Just... unbelievable.

Yeah, but you said that he was advocating for homelessness as a crime, and imprisonment as a solution, and that's a misrepresentation. A treatment center is not the same thing as prison. And he also never said anything about the facility itself providing the heroin to the users, only that they'd be free to use there. The way I read it was as a voluntary treatment center for the homeless to enter, and to use in an environment with help readily available. While I don't agree with his enthusiasm for their deaths, I do think that a large scale treatment program, integrated into an area where users can congress isn't the worst idea. I certainly don't enjoy the bi-monthy, "let's pull heroin needles out of our shrubs today," myself, and my roommates are forced to do. I live in an area very close to a high school, and kids pass by those shrubs 5x a week. 

I'm sorry, but it's not my neighbors leaving them, it's the homeless people who walk through our neighborhood a couple times a day, talking to themselves, and coming by our house to grab half-finished cigarettes off our porch at night. If you don't think that, at least, the homeless have a much higher rate of drug use, you're wrong. You should take a look at [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_APGlDRfRk)

I don't recall saying that it wasn't my problem and that we should "let someone else deal with it."  And, judging from my facebook feed lots of people I know were against the eviction of Tent City.

Also, I'm balls deep in the problem every week taking people to the hospital when they've busted their head or breathing for them when they've od'd on heroin, and a lot of the problem is that you can't force people to change.  While there needs to be more done, there are many opportunities afforded to the homeless in Albuquerque that they actively avoid.

I had a friend who was murdered a while back. She played Prius Online with us the entire time.

I still weirds me out that she's actually gone.

I saw a screenshot with her in it a while ago, I just sat there.

Anyone who says online friendships are meaningless... doesn't understand.

Edit: I should have worded that better. I didn't mean she was killed while she was playing. I meant she was part of our group the whole time we knew her. 

What happened is something I blame myself for. Both her and I were going through some really hard times. And I'll never forget what I told her. She wanted out of the miserable situation she was in. That game Prius, was her escape, but once she logged of or her aunt made her get of her laptop, she was being abused and treated like a trash. She asked me what she could do. I told her this "There's 2 ways out of this, you either kill yourself, or you leave." Now when I said that I meant that with as much goodwill as I could say that with, and she knew why I said it. I was in a really bad situation too. Both of us had considered the possibility of suicide because of how shitty both our lives had become. That's one of the reasons we ended up so close. We talked everyday even outside of the game.

She didnt want me to die and I didn't want her to die either, but neither of us really had a way out.

Back to what I said to her "You either kill yourself or you leave" She chose to leave, and I left my situation as well. We kept contact via email.

She went to a program that helped troubled youth get back on her feet, she was getting somewhere. Then someone else who knew her told me something was going on with her. She had let someone take her virginity in some random bathroom, and I tried to talk to her. This was a girl who was pretty innocent so I'm pretty sure she was forced.

Turns out she ended up stop going to that program, and then.

Her emails stopped.

I called homeless shelters, and eventually the police.

I asked desperately to find her.

Police couldn't help me, and by this time I was homeless too, sleeping on some random persons couch. I had no power nothing I could do.

Then I got the call.

They found her dead in an ally.

Someone had injected her with some 3 times the legal dose of Heroine. She would never do drugs, she's not the type. clean to heroine junky in a few weeks? There was no way. 

Someone killed her.

And I feel like it's my fault, I told her to leave her aunt's. and she left.

It's been a little more than 3 years since that call.

I'm still not used her not being here. I don't think I ever will.

Even in these discussions on a site where we can be so brutally frank no one really brings up the for/against on reestablishing the state mental hospital system for the chronically mentally ill and forcibly medicating them against their wishes.  

The against is that back in the day, it was abused by institutionalizing those who weren't chronically and dangerously mentally ill, or had conditions (such as "being a gay person" or "being a woman who desired to vote") considered mental illness that we now know are not.  People could undergo lobotomies and electroshock for being gay, for instance.  

Another against is that there is institutional abuse today because of low pay and poor supervision.  We just don't want to spend a lot on people who are not considered to contribute to society, which is incredibly sad.  We don't see the timeline on these things, that a former mental patient can become a highly productive member of society.  You'd never know if the normal dude you just met was involuntarily committed.  And I say this because I know a mental health therapist here in town who is highly respected, well liked, appears normal - and spent three years in a state psychiatric hospital many years ago.

Whenever we try to imagine the mentally ill homeless people we see today recovering, we only see in our heads the folks downtown we know don't have enough time left in their lives to recover.  We may see the street kids and think they are incorrigible... and again I think of people I know who live a nice life these days, contribute to society generally, who were heroin addicted street kids in the 90s.  

The for is that the cost to society is too high to not draw our lines a little more tightly around who should be commitable and who shouldn't.

I say that as someone who meets several definitions of mental illness.  I'm cognizant that I'd want myself committed to an institution where I'd be locked up, forced to take drugs, and receive therapy if I were to lose my grip on reality, for my family's sake.  I'd want to get better and get back to them.

You know the worst part is that this isn't the first time I've had a relationship end tragically. 

I lived in the US till I was 22 and my last year there (before I moved to Ecuador to live with my Grandparents.) I was homeless. At the time and attended Narcotics Anonimos meetings mostly to have people to relate to and talk and free cigarettes. 

I met a girl there named Chandra and she was a recovering Oxycotin addict in one of the many halfway houses in Delray,Fl. I liked her look and she smoked cigs so I bummed one and talked. She invited me out to eat (I wasn't planning on dating at the time). We started going out for a month and went out to eat, the beach, starbucks with her housemates.

I was happy and homeless. I slept in abandoned houses but she didn't mind that and the fact that I smoked weed. She knew I smoed and met my friend that was my dealer (middleman, in Delray you cant be white and buy drugs easily). Slowly she started hanging out with the three of us. Most the time just relaxing and smoking weed.


 One day we were smoking in a abandoned house and Chandra asks me to step outside(i dont remember the reason). So I sat outside 15min until my friend opened the door and left. I go back inside to  Chandra shooting up Oxycotin. That in itself was shocking.

We sat down and talked and maybe it was the Oxy talking but she told me what went down. My friend had been selling her pills for a couple of weeks and that day he asked for sex instead of cash. I'm an addict and can understand her willingness to give into the craving.

After she told me we smoked some bowls and went to a nearby gas station and I bought some munchies and some sodas. We went back to the house and just stayed talking and eating till she was sleepy and was resting on my lap. 

Lo and behold my friend came in with his friend. I don't know if she knew ahead of time because she just got up and left with them (I later found what i knew that was for some more oxys for ass). I was left there. I just smoked till I passed out.

We still hung out after that but things were different. A week later she had a OD on cocaine and was hospatalized and that was when her parents decided to bring her home (she was from Georgia). I met up with her once more before she left we went skinny dipping at the beach and ended the night at starbucks for old times sakes.

This was 3yrs ago. Still message her on FB occassionally. Last I heard she just got out of rehab and is doing voulenteer work.

**Tl;dr: Had a girlfriend while homeless. She relapsed on drugs. Prostituted herself to a friend and his friend. Had a OD on heroin. Her parents from a state away brought her home after the OD.**

These are the only two relationships I ever had.This has made me hesitant to get with someone antime soon. Thinking about the good times are nice but then you remember how it ended. Only reason I might date again is because  I don't think it could go any worse

Broke this up to be safe, I'm on my phone and if I tried to send that and got a word limit then somehow lost it all I would cry lol. 

I understand why you would see meth or heroin users like that, but you should learn to let go of those preconceived notions piece by piece. The drug world is quite different in many ways than the image much of society has of it. For one thing, we'we're **EVERYWHERE**. Absolutely, with only the occasion extreme case being an exception. I'd bet good money you've dealt with people on a whole lot of different drugs without ever knowing it. Plenty may, but far from all drug users look the stereotypical part. I myself am tall, white, glasses, khaki shorts, white undershirt, button up collared shirt guy. I've never felt a need to express myself via personal appearance, and these clothes keep me safe. No one looks twice at you, no one questions you or bats an eye, and that includes cops. Very handy.

Over time you'll come to see that while the drug content on tomorrow's front page is fact, it isn't often representative of the full reality. Yes there are people that wind up homeless due to heroin addiction, yes people wind up in jail with bug eyes and no teeth from crystal meth, but these cases are the minority on one extreme of the spectrum. No one ever talks about the safe responsible drug use, because it isn't in the news. It stays behind locked doors. People only see individuals living the wrong lifestyle because if they were doing it right they'd  ever know.

The meth look for example. Dirty, covered in scabs, wide scared eyes, with only a few cracked brown teeth left. It keeps you up for days, and some people forget or ignore regular showers. Just set reminders. The wide eyed look would be from being really high and up for several days which causes sleep deprivation that makes the world *weird*. So don't stay up too long, and if you have don't leave the house. Amphs cause dry mouth admittedly, and some people grind their teeth, but nothing about it rots your teeth. Keep your mouth moist, remember to brush regularly, avoid grinding, and you won't have a problem. The image comes from people who have unfortunately been using far too much for far too long, they aren't the norm.

2 friends I remember the most. The first friend lived in low-income housing &amp; there were maybe 3 pillows in the whole house, on her moms bed. One time when I was there, my friend's punishment for doing nothing was her mom's boyfriend shoving his tongue down my friends throat. And I specifically remember a punishment in which I had to squat against the wall, holding my arms out for a time, and I was naked. Totally normal stuff to this family. My friend is a heroin addict now. Her mom is married to the guy now. 

The second friend lived in a trailer court when I did. Her mom was known in the trailer court as the woman who would run to your trailer asking to call police on her boyfriend, usually preceded by the phrase "Can you see if I have cum on me!?" It was a common occurrence for her boyfriend to 'throw a fit' resulting in personal injury, a huge mess, and/or sexual assault. They also had to remove their flooring &amp; live on just wood planks because they kept getting more dogs that they never walked....ever. And yes, my friend loved to start howling so the dogs got stirred up enough to all howl and whine inside a small, 2 bedroom trailer. Basically, they lived in complete chaos up until her mom ran away with the boyfriend. My friend had no idea what happened to her mom until a holiday brought them together again. Now, my friend is married to a man worse than her step-dad...But, she seems happy.

Because we live in a free country and who are you to tell me that I can't spend my evenings smoking weed?

Also because the chemically produced drugs (coke, meth, crack, heroin etc) leave your system much faster than, say, THC from cannabis, which means that with drug tests, you bust the stoners, and not those who take hard drugs. But yeah, you know it all, even if you don't even know the slightest bit about drugs, so we should trust your judgement and start drug testing everyone every single month. You too, by the way. You'd like that, wouldn't you? A nce and cozy police state where the citizens are the property of the government, where the government tells you what you are allowed to do and what you are allowed to ingest.

This is why people on welfare shouldn't be drug tested. Because it's not your dmn business. For every one person that spends welfare solely on drugs, there are a hundred that use it to feed their children, try and get a job etc. But yup, bust them all, especially the stressed out parents of little children taking care of them all day, making sure they have something to eat. Get them off welfare because the parents sometimes smoke a joint after their kids went to bed. Because those are the people you bust with drug tests. You take their last chance of getting out of poverty and force them into crime, in the worst case.

Voluntary homeless are not my favorite part of my city. But your question is asking how easy it is, and I'd say the whole crusty community is very generous. I don't actually know of any pitbull-dreadlocks-heroin young homeless who don't actually have a squat or group house somewhere. There's a thriving system of sharing, including sharing the dogs to help with spangeing.

The main neighborhood you're going to find other crusties to help you is West 4th street up to the Union Square area. Coincidentally, there are a couple of methadone clinics in the area, and many of your comrades are going to be on that, not heroin.

Good luck.

I saw a show about this doctor who tends to the worst of the worst homeless/addicts in Florida, I think. He was tending to this heroin addict who had  a huge chunk of his intestines on the outside of his stomach. He can't get it fixed because he can't stay off of heroin for more than a handful of hours, and no hospital will risk putting him under for surgery. So this doctor comes along every so often with fresh bandages for the guy....

Sorry, Devil Dog, I hate to inform you this but OP's not Navy. He's an 18 year old kid who likes to pretend that he's either a Navy Seal, Corpsman, Marine, or an intelligence officer working in the Pentagon. You should ask him how he deployed to Iraq in 2008 at the age of 11. It's very amusing.

I'd like you all to say hi to Skye. He likes to pretend like he's in the military (see below for his past claims on alternate accounts). If you were in the military; you'd know that a majority of service members smoke cigarettes and they have smoking areas set aside for smokers. No one gives you crap for smoking in the military since almost everyone does that. But what do I know, I was actually in the military.

So far, I'm tracking 12 different users names (most of which he has deleted after it is easily discovered that he isn't what he claims to be): /u/Skye2880, /u/NAVSPECWARGRUONE, /u/CodyPavilionis, /u/TheDoctor04, /u/OfficialLAPD, /u/Throwaway14885, /u/NSWThrowaway4, /u/3042001, /u/Corpsman06, /u/BUDS239, /u/TheEcoTerroristInMe, /u/USMC1048, and USN233

Portland feels your pain. Our downtown has quite similar problems. We have amazing greenspace around the river that has become the turf of bike thieves, heroin addicts, homeless campers, thugs, and meth-heads to openly engage in their behavior. The city does little to stem the problem because of the obsession with consensus and making sure nobody is offended and nobody's fee-fees get hurt. Though we have several task forces that will submit reports to a steering committee which will ultimately issues recommendations to city council.

Like you, we benefit from being a progressive city, but have a small contingent of extreme leftists with their heads in the sand - everyone described above are holy to them, and they must be displayed up front to demonstrate how awful capitalism is, and anyone taking issue with these worsening quality of life issues are literally Hitler. We have a homeless activist as our parks commissioner - permanent vagrant camps in parks are now the norm. While we have a generous plan to end homelessness, the passive attitude toward bad behavior leaves us with more and more homeless and junkies coming here to take advantage of what is essentially a free-love approach to our problems.

Unlike you, we're all income tax, which is just as bad as all sales tax. Any time the economy goes south, revenues plunge harder than any other state, so the increase in people in need get met with fewer resources than in good times.  But we're also saddled with multiple ballot initiatives that hamstring effective government services.

I would never live in downtown Portland for the similar reasons - I don't want to deal with sidewalk-shitters, junkies, and homeless camps that double as stolen bike chop shops - all of this right out in the open and deliberately not addressed.

tl;dr - Portland has the same downtown issues as Seattle, for the same reason, the city government does not care, and none of this is expected to change.

As someone who spent a year homeless I can safely say that 99% of money you give to beggar "cripples"(usually fakers) and the homeless goes for buying alcohol, tobacco, crack, meth, and heroin.

There have been some great posts regarding this subject in the past.  You could the search function and maybe even find one specific to Philly.  

My quick tips:

1. Don't let your money walk.  
2. Only carry just enough money to get a small amount. Find something good and go back for more after you figure out who is legit.  
3. Don't take any other valuable with you.  
4. Try to blend in,  or look the part,  as much as possible.  
5. Take some smokes and when someone asks to bum one, ask where they might find something.  
6. Be prepared to pay someone a few bucks or offer to buy them one or two bags if they help you source something. 
7. Find likely suspects... homeless, hookers, people hanging outside of a needle exchange/methadone clinic,  etc, to ask for assistance finding a connect/corner/what have you. 

I'm sure I'm forgetting something,  but just try searching "cold copping heroin in Philly" or something like that.  I'm sure you will turn up some good info. If you are really trying to do this, from what I gather, cold copping in Philadelphia is totslly doable. Good luck, be careful,  and listen to your instincts.  If you feel bad about aa situation,  good chance it's for good reason.

When I made my observation I was only thinking that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But your comment about having no soul affected me in a surprising way. You see I've known a lot of homeless people... a lot... I've been homeless myself and I've helped a lot of homeless people . I've had homeless people live with me. And I suspect that you view homeless people as I once did.

It's nowhere near as simple as thinking that you can just provide someone with housing and declare the problem solved. There are a lot of anciliary problems that come with homelessness... mental, emotional, behavioral issues. Take for example one man I knew of and note that this is not a rare example. I called him the swaying man.

He stood on a street corner off of Broadway in downtown Los Angeles not exactly in Skid Row but not too far from it. Every day rain or shine he stood there, swaying. He never spoke, never begged, near as I could tell never changed his clothes. He just stood there swaying. Eventually I learned his story... he was a heroin addict. At the beginning of every month he got his SSI deposit and went on a three or four day heroin binge.  And then he just stood there and swayed.

It would be quite impossible to simply house this man. He needed to be in a nursing home with mental health professionals. Do you know what that would've cost? The reality is that most of the homeless people that I met could not be housed could not maintain could not function. 

The grim reality is that we don't have the system we have to maintain salaries. We have it because it is an economical humane solution to deal with a very problematic population. Going cheaper still would be a fucking disaster.

How do the homeless afford cocaine or heroin?

It's in the hands of heroin and crack dealers, since everyone on welfare is buying drugs in mass quantities, apparently

yeah i spent a lot of time trying to semi-diagnose this guy. i literally have no idea. dude had elements of just about every personality disorder i could come up with.

things in my life are great, after this period i spent some time homeless, then started to slowly get my shit together. i had been hooked on opiates since i was 13, which was when my nerve pain (CRPS) first started. so it was really hard for me to stay clean. even if i isolated myself and deleted all my dealers' numbers, i could still just walk into any doctor's office with my CD and get a buttload of oxycodone. so throughout school i would clean up, appease the people in my life, then secretly start using again, gradually accelerate my usage, get close to a logistical or financial crisis, then clean up again. it was a real vicious cycle, particularly because when i'd quit, i would be exposed to immense amounts of nerve pain because of the sensitivity caused by the withdrawal, and i'd be unable to sleep for about 5 or 6 days sometimes. but if i didn't quit, i would hardly learn anything. i wasn't sleeping or nodding out all the time because i had a pretty intense tolerance going, but i would skip class to play video games and scratch my balls, and even when i'd go to class i'd spend 20% of the time in the bathroom either gearing up or trying to poop. then when i'd get home i wouldn't have any energy or motivation to do homework. so basically it was really hard for me to get through school on heroin, and almost impossible for me to get through school without it. i was really stuck between a rock and a hard place for a long time.

eventually after all these complete and utter failures, i decided i didn't really mind being on an opiate all the time, as long as it didn't impair me or hurt my health. so i got on suboxone, which if you haven't heard is basically a drug that fills the same role as methadone. it performs its duties better, because when you're on suboxone you can't really get high on regular opiates. actually, it was generic buprenorphine, but it's the same stuff in a different preparation. methadone actually gives you a slight high, whereas this stuff does pretty much one thing: keeps you from going into withdrawals. it basically agonizes the opiate receptors just enough to prevent withdrawal, but not enough to stimulate abuse or anything like that. plus there's a ceiling effect, so no matter how much you take you can't get a stronger effect, and it's impossible to overdose on. tolerance doesn't really get any higher, it hits a peak and then just stops. i've been on it for a few years now and it does cause a few problems, such as bizarre and frequent nightmares, and horrible sleep paralysis. but it's better than withdrawal and totally uninhibited nerve pain. i just kinda accept where i'm at with it and keep moving forward.

if i tell myself "you're not good enough because you're still taking an addictive drug, and when you quit taking this you're still gonna get sick as hell," i just get depressed honestly. when i think about it rationally, i realize that there's really no reason to be ashamed of being dependent on a specific chemical. tons of people are dependent on caffeine and nicotine. actually i'm pretty much dependent on nicotine, but i use a vaporizer these days. anyway point is, i'm not doing anything to hurt my health or incapacitate my mind. i'm not accelerating my dependence either. i'm just basically in stasis right now, in terms of my addiction "level." but it's not hurting me the way opiates were, especially IV dilaudid, so i don't feel an urgent desire to get off, or a shame that i have to repress.

i can't say i'm truly *clean*, because of this medication (which i'm legally prescribed) BUT i can say that my life is way better now, i have a good job and a caring family and a great lover. i also associate online with a lot of fellow heroin addicts who are on the same medication i'm on, and they have pretty much the same experience with it. it's not "clean" but there's no real reason we need to get off it. and trust me, that's not denial talking. haha.

thanks for asking by the way

edit: also, "necronomikin." fucking genius.

why does he want to disappear? just doesn't wanna pay taxes? or does he just want to drop off the governments radar scot-free?

if your friend can act a little, he can fake a suicide close enough to where they'll write him off pretty quickly. 

there's a lot of indicators for suicidal behavior. your friend can start withdrawing from friends/co-workers/classmates for a little while. stop hanging out, cut back on work/school camaraderie, have a couple of senseless outbursts in front of people. then when your friend does talk to people, he should always mention being under a lot of stress, but never actually confirm where it's coming from. maybe start taking shitty care of himself for awhile. wait a couple days between showers, wear the same clothes 2-3 days in a row, and maybe go on an extreme diet for a couple months.

then, in a short period of time, like a week, your friend should give away a bunch of his shit. like, big important stuff. family heirloom? give it to a random friend for "safekeeping", give away a bunch of his money (if applicable) to random people, and maybe something random like putting his oven out on the curb with a "free" sign on it and giving his childhood possessions to a charity.

then, scatter a bunch of drug paraphernalia around his house (even better if he leaves some actual drugs, like heroin, meth, or cocaine), and a bunch of empty liquor bottles. 

finally, call a couple of friends/coworkers in the middle of the night and apologize for acting weird, and say shit like "i'm gonna make it right" with no real explanation. it'll help if he can actually sound drugged up or drunk or something. 

then he should hop in his car, drive up into the woods, or to the ocean, or to a popular suicide destination (the golden gate bridge, for example). leave some paraphernalia in the car, along with the keys, and just walk away, hop on a bus, and go somewhere else. 

there will be a small police investigation once either the car is found, or (even better) if someone files a missing persons report, but once they start hearing about your friend's increasingly odd behavior, drastic weight loss, and depression, they'll write it off as a drug-fueled downward life spiral and assume your friend just ran off and killed themselves.

that's the easy part. the hard part is supporting himself afterwards. it's hard to make money without legal identification. it's possible to assemble a fake identity with someone else's social security number (this is how some illegal immigrants find work in the u.s.), but that can backfire pretty quickly if the person who's number your friend acquires dies, has a criminal record, or runs a credit report. 

my recommendation would be to go a different route. 

there's a whole underground culture of people in the u.s. who have managed to fall off the radar, legally speaking. depending on how adventurous your friend is, he could eventually join them. 

-i know people who run or work on weed farms and haven't paid taxes in over a decade. it's like the crab fishing lifestyle, but illegal. they'll work a few months out of the year during "trim season", and earn enough to live the rest of the year. granted, they usually have a frugal life in the off-season, but they can still afford to feed themselves and travel.

-i know people who spent ten-ish grand on a boat, learned to sail, and now spend most the year sailing around the world. they'll find random under-the-counter jobs to pay for supplies, and then it's back to the sea they go. 

-i know a couple older dudes that have woodworking or construction skills. they make a living by offering cheaper labor, but only take cash. the dude across the street from me hasn't had any contact with/from the government for something like 20 years. 

-i know places in the u.s. where whole communities have sprung up in the middle of nowhere. the police know they're there, but don't/can't really do anything about it. [slab city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City) is one of them. there are others even further off the radar. 

there's a whole list of skills your friend can learn to make off-the-record money in america. just look at the "services offered" and "gigs" section of your local craigslist. it's full of auto mechanics, general contractors, nannies, tutors, massage therapists (therapeutic *and* sexual), web designers, and housecleaners. 

you think all those people are filing taxes on income they make on the side? hell no. i'm a massage therapist. i do have a legit job in a chiropractic office i pay taxes on, but when someone contacts me for my private practice (i have a space in my home as well), i pocket all that. 

if i wanted to, i could lower my expenses by living on a boat or in an van or someshit, and maybe rent a room in a friend's house to work out of a couple days a week. then, i wouldn't have any paperwork anywhere attaching me to anything. 

i wouldn't be legally dead, but barring getting pulled over by the police (which is hard for me cuz i'm kinda brown), i'd be effectively untraceable. statistically i'd be just another homeless person.
