Somebody just found at that her former job sent her a check for $2252 in unpaid overtime!!! This will cover the debt I owe Fire Credit Union that I transferred over from Wells Fargo, and it will at least cover a fat portion of a security deposit on a new place when my bf and I move this summer. Man, I am very pleased with this development. 
Seriously, I worked my ass off at that job when I had it. I was an on-call counselor at residential treatment facilities for people with mental illness. 75% of the clients were also addicts, and 99% of them were from SF's homeless population. I loved that job but the agency didn't treat its employees well and eventually I had to get the fuck out. This money is SO awesome! 
On another note - still feeling optimistic (maybe bc of the $$$) but it's only the second game of the season. Goddamn though if the Giants shouldn't just reserve like 1/3 of the DL for their team though. Injuries suck. IDGF, I love Romo and his awesome Romo-ness. I believe in you, buddy! Immytay too, but I'm too scared to say so openly because then the gods will notice and hex him further.
I've had some beers. I should stop posting now.

If you're new to the city James Bay and Fairfield are the best areas to live. You'll be walking distance to Banks, grocery stores, gyms, restaurants, and bars. I lived in the cook street village area for over 10 years myself. No area is really bad in the city, but they're a few spots where walking home drunk can be a problem. The city's homeless, drug addicted or those suffering from mental illness are pleasant just let them do their thing. 

If you're any visible minority you won't have any problem, Victoria is rather passive aggressive and we'll only talk shit behind your back.

I think he or she is making the leap that because many homeless people are mentally ill, that this particular homeless person was mentally ill. It's certainly convenient to blame their crimes on their illness.
<TRUE,TRUE>

But a lot of mental illness is a factor in homelessness which makes substance abuse rampant. Throwing money at a homeless person isn't always a good thing. This seems like a rare thing to be honest.

I go back and forth on having sympathy for drug/alcohol addicts. I've semen it ruin so many friend/families lives and how selfish most of them were and I tend to not want to be bothered anymore. But like I said, I go back and forth because the ones that seem close to their bottom, I think I kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel for them. I think currently the pill head/ Heroin addicts I know that can get help but flat out don't give a shit about anyone but themselves have sort of blinded me to being able to sympathize. 

And I'm not talking about the people who have absolutely nothing.  The homeless/ destitute/mentally ill. I still have sympathy for them 
<TRUE,FALSE>

They are in a homeless shelter, but if they are taken at their word, they have no other issues. They are simply poor. They are not mentally ill, substance dependent, or abusive. They are not even unemployed. Taking their child from them for poverty would be Dickensian cruelty. All their problems could be solved by a little cash from the government, which is not the case for most homeless families. Why pay foster carers to take care of their baby when they could do it themselves, given the same money?

Because I got downvoted to shit when I responded last time, let me help you out with a source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics)

Eugenics as a movement grew out of the proposition that the insane should be sterilized by castration or spaying. In the 1930's, it became a political pseudo-scientific movement which served as a justification for the racial policies of Nazi Germany. To quote directly from the article: "The methods of implementing eugenics varied by country; however, some early 20th century methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, promiscuous women, homosexuals, and racial groups (such as the Roma and Jews in Nazi Germany) as "degenerate" or "unfit", the segregation or institutionalization of such individuals and groups, their sterilization, euthanasia, and their mass murder."

In recent history, sterilization has been proposed and administered to prisoners, often against their will, in this very country: "During the years 2005–06 to 2012–13, nearly one-third of the 144 California prison inmates who were sterilized did not give lawful consent to the operation." 

Here's where we differ: I believe that the words "genetically inferior" are subjective. They have a different meaning to everyone depending on their culture of origin, and therefore they cannot and should not ever be run by a government. It is not the government's right to say what is or is not genetically inferior or superior. If we were to say that people with a certain condition should not have children, then why should we stop there? Prevent poor people, socialists, prisoners, mentally disabled people, black people, hispanic people, non-Christians, English majors, whomever you'd like! If you're the government, you can just say "here's an ideal person, if you're not going to make these then you can't make children at all." That does not happen in America. Now get your Eugenics out of here and back to 1930's Germany where it belongs.

&gt; I'm inclined to believe you're not all that familiar with the homeless, if you're presuming their lying on the street is rooted in failures on the part of politicians.

Holy shit man, the conservatives and liberals FUCKED the mentally ill in the ass with a hot poker during the 80s and 90s. They closed down mental health centers all over the country. Basically if a person was institutionalized but capable of feeding themselves, they were thrown into a group home or into the street. If you don't think that politicians have contributed to the mentally ill and homeless problem in our country you are ignorant.
<TRUE,TRUE>

I'll take a shot at answering your question.

Most of the population, especially in first world countries who aren't homeless gradually tend to see people living on the streets more as objects than humans. This is really evident in places where humans live in large cities crippled by homelessness every corner.

It's not that they don't want to think of them as humans, but it becomes easier to go throughout your day when you see these people asking for food or money and in obviously atrocious situations with the "inability" to donate to each and every one of them. Therefore, some people also begin to develop excuses for that and attach stereotypes to every one of them. For example they'll begin to think that they'll mostly all use the money for drugs or alcohol, or that they've all put themselves there and deserve no help. Perhaps, most are just mentally ill and our money won't help them. They become irrelevant to our lives and it's easier to go about your day not thinking about their poor situation. Videos like this "humanize" them and put us back into perspective that they're really just humans, normal people, who all deserve chances to get back up and be offered a way out.

Edit 1: eg. One of the most downvoted comments by /u/OPisalwaysfaggot  here (likely a troll) show someone's thinking who has absolutely been ignorant to the situation as a whole, saying 
&gt;"that's what happens when they become drug addicted ill minded fuckwits."

While I agree this is a problem and there are many fakes out there, there are also many homeless/disadvantaged people on the street due to mental illness, which is by no means "their own life choice".

Forcing people to buy the cheapest stuff IS forcing people to buy a certain brand.

Also, who are we to tell people they can't have like...one fucking nice thing.  The vast majority of people who are on welfare are there temporarily.  What if they have a tradition of having crab legs on New Year's?  You're gonna tell them that because they lost their job or their spouse died or left them or whatever that they can't buy some certain item?  What if they want to eat Ramen one month to save up their benefits to carry on their tradition?  So what? 

You're saying things that are easy to say for someone who's never been there.  You have to be there to see how thin that line really is between poor and true poverty. 

Humiliation comes in many flavors.  Being told you can't make your own decisions is one of them.  Who else can't make their own decisions?  Who else is not free? Children...prisoners...the most severely mentally ill among us....and...now welfare recipients?

So everyone knows, that 80-95% number for prevalence of mental illness in this abstract includes substance abuse. The general figure for non-substance related mental illness in homeless persons is figured to be lower, usually around 25%, although studies will vary.
<TRUE,TRUE>

I've never had a homeless person be rude to me. Generally, if you say you have no money, they just thank you and move on. Most of them seem to be totally happy just to get something to eat (I usually get stopped outside of the grocery store, and I'll give them some of my less perishable, ready-to-eat items if they're accepting food.) I had a pleasant conversation with a guy with an imaginary brother a couple weeks ago. Nice guy. Too bad about the mental illness.

A few unexplored explanations:

* LGBT youth are 2 to 3 times more likely to be homeless. Parental support and finances are a huge part of acquiring birth control for youth.

* LGBT youth are more likely to suffer from mental illness and mood altering victimization. I can easily see how this could lead to riskier behavior.

* Transgendered youth are less likely to have health insurance. Body dysphoria probably doesn't help either. (Why take female birth control when someone identifies as male? Etc).

* By definition, this study is pitting LGBT youth with at least two partners (one male, one female) against heterosexual youth with at least one partner. I'm not certain there is a link between pregnancy and amount of partners, but I'd imagine there is.

Just some things to think about.

It is really easy to say, "Well, duh. Bisexuals are slutty." Or something of that sort, but it really isn't a simple issue. And even if bisexuals do have higher rates of sexual incidents, consider that maybe there are social causes, and the differences aren't inherent.

i don't hesitate either.  
  
 i do tenfold the amount of good for the world than you do if giving to charity equates directly to helping the less fortunate (it doesn't), year in year out--at the very least--just by assumption.  
  
 every year i could buy myself a 10k sq ft house and not think any differently of my situation.  
  
 instead i donate at least 3 million dollars of my annual income to the needy, the mentally ill, and the sick. those are the bases i try to cover with my charity work.   
  
you might say i can't compare the two because relatively it's inexpensive for me. that you give the same portion of your income when you donate a few thousand annually, but that's not how the world works. it's not tragic for me to have money.  
  
 it's not a tragedy.  
  
 the point is money doesn't equate to happiness, and that's all this has been about.  
  
  
through discussion, exchanging of experience, and pretty specific examples, i have shown you how that is true--where everything on my end, for you, is speculation.  
  
again, if this were a hypothetical situation, i would like to see what would happen to you if suddenly you had the amount of money i have, with my life experience along with it.  
  
 i would like to see how easily it was for you to get rid of that money. to choose over a thousand charities, to try not to cave under the pressure, to try not to worry about where that money goes once you're rid of it. because in this world, money is power, and even charities (believe it or not!) often use that power for company funding and political agenda while children die in hospital beds and the mentally ill blend with the homeless do to exorbitant costs of medication.  
  
i do my part to make sure the money i donate goes to a good spot, more so than most of the global population, let alone actually donating more than most of the global population
  
unless i know the charity in-and-out, and there are only a few which i do (through years of research and interaction), i might as well be donating to corporations or political campaigns that i do not agree with or with whose agendas i am not familiar.  
  
i am starting to think that the money is less reason for this divide--that more of your misunderstanding comes from lack of life experience in general. it seems as though you're still learning (we all are, until death--however here it seems concepts of wealth and business are wasted on you, and philanthropy is dealt with as an ideal, not a weighed concept as a means for good.)  
  
i hope i have done at least a little to help you understand or perhaps create a more realistic lense for you to look through

It appears to be more of a union issue if anything. You could easily take hundreds of the city's homeless, stick a broom in their hand for minimum wage, and take care of this problem overnight. Even mentally ill people with no skills can work a broom. 

However, the municipal unions would throw a hissyfit that they weren't using union members getting paid $90/hr with a pension &amp; full benefits, and ultimately kill any hope at clean streets or the extra jobs.

Senator Sanders,

I recently had a discussion with a few friends about the ability of illegal immigrants to enter the US and receive not only a primary education, but in state tuition rates and scholarships for higher education. One person I was with seemed very unhappy that his tax dollars are being used for these purposes. It made me curious what your stance on the rights of illegal immigrants is as well as immigration law in general. Additionally, I live in the heart of Seattle, and something I see every day is how many of the mentally ill and addicts are homeless on the streets. It is my belief that these people should not be abandoned and left to suffer and die without aid, but I am unsure how this problem can be solved. What is your solution to this problem?

Thanks for your time and I look forward to seeing this grassroots movement take off!

My SO is from the area, I never heard about the homeless being shuffled off to Baldwin Park. I can believe it, though. SO's mom had to go to the ER at the BP hospital and it was like something out of a movie - homeless, mentally ill people everywhere, a guy screaming and being hauled off in cuffs, stray cats all over the grounds... It was one of the scariest places I've ever been.

From the article you posted. 

&gt; **Substance abuse was the single largest cause of homelessness** for single adults (reported by 68% of cities).
&gt; Substance abuse was also mentioned by 12% of cities as one of the top three causes of homelessness for
&gt; families According to Didenko and Pankratz (2007), **two-thirds of homeless people report that drugs
and/or alcohol were a major reason for their becoming homeless.** 

http://www.portlandrescuemission.org/learn-more/causes-of-homelessness/

Top 3 causes for homelessness

1. Addiction
2. Domestic Violence
3. Mental illness


So I think it's fair to say that *usually*, people become homeless because of drugs and/or mental illness. That's not to say all the people who are homeless are homeless because of substance abuse or mental illness, just that it's pretty usual for that to be the reason.

At least be honest with yourself, you can't begin to solve a problem when you are too worried about being politically correct that you can't identify the largest problem. 
<TRUE,TRUE>

Yeah, this article rubbed me the wrong way. 

I can't fathom getting upset from someone saying thanks. They're being respectful. They're not prying. They're not asking if you've killed anyone or if any of your brothers were lost.

My generation has grown up with images/videos/movies about the vietnam vets returning and being hated by society and becoming homeless, mentally ill and drug addicted. 

I remember a massive push in middle/high school to respect the soldier not the war. All of this "thank you for your service" stems from that. We were shown constantly at how poorly servicemen were treated after Vietnam and there was a pretty concerted effort to not have that occur again.

&gt;I think the best analogies for my case is the fat guy that keeps going to the gym, but can't drop a pound, because he always "rewards himself with a burger / fries / cake" 

Weight is controlled by many variables.   You can't look at a fat guy and know why he's fat.  So this analogy doesn't work.

&gt; you provide a safety net or some other type of welfare program, so now the "poor folk" save 100$ or 200$ or however much the program saves them, but instead of using that money to better their lives on the long-term, they dump them in a new expensive bag, shoes, first-class tickets to a match or what-have-you. 

If you really think poor people on welfare are living the life of luxury, you've never seen the projects.    You're making a lot of assumptions. 

&gt;My point is that creating massive welfare programs isn't going to stop poverty, no amount of government interference would ever erase poverty. In fact, there'll always be a large group (dare I say majority) of "working class" who are stuck in their position not because of the lack of hard work or talent, but because they have absolutely no self-control when it comes to spending.

Spending is half the equation.   But if a person would only be able to earn $15k a year, financial classes won't change that they will always be in a deficit.   There is a minimum amount of money a person must earn to afford food,  clothes, shelter, medical care, and other absolute essentials.    Doesn't matter how many classes a person takes, they still need those essentials.

You need to consider why a person is in poverty.  It could be mental illness.   It could be physical disability.  Could be that they live in a part of the country where unemployment is significant.  

Women with kids tend to be a group likely to end up in poverty.   Did you know childcare [costs more than college]( http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/04/news/economy/child-care-costs-college/)?  

Medical bills are a top reason why an ordinary person [can end up in bankruptcy]( http://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148).   Now they have bad credit and probably reduced ability to work.  
 
Lecturing them to clip coupons or buy things on sale won't fix these problems.   

And the one big problem I have with how America does social programs is that there's this big gap between poverty level living with benefits and a living wage.   raises and promotions happen incrementally.   A person who keeps working full time and gets one or two little raises lose their benefits.  Their quality of life drops significantly when they lose medical coverage.  If the average family insurance plan [costs $22k]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2013/05/22/annual-healthcare-costs-surpasses-22000/) and employees are still paying less than $10.00/hour, what do they do?  Do you work full time and lose heath coverage for your family knowing you can't afford to buy it out right?   Or do you work a little less, get health needs met (medicaid), and also get food and childcare subsidized?     

Being poor isn't fun.   Instead of seeing them as lacking self control or being dumb, I propose we address the social and economic reasons why people end up earning so little they can't afford essentials and are eligible for welfare. 
<TRUE,TRUE>
------
Part of the issue is that many people think it is not possible for those who try to end up there. I used to be amongst those who thought the poor were just drug addicts and people with mental illness, then I got diagnosed with a mental illness, and as it happens I cannot work (I risk developing psychotic episodes under stress, and have a long history of hospitalizations behind me). Now, for reference, this is Sweden, and I STILL live on marginal income. What I receive is roughly half of what is considered the poverty line here. In most countries it is worse.

Now, what this does of course mean is that I have no choice but to postpone things like medicines and dental care from time to time, with the consequence being that the problems get worse, until eventually I end up qualifying for some form of assistance, making things even more costly for society. For those who are homeless the equation is even worse, with shelters and emergency room visits racking up expenses multiple times what a 1-room apartment would have cost.

It really is a case of the rational solution being politically unpopular, much like the war on drugs. It is easy to justify shaming the unemployed and ill, but the consequences of cutting basic services is just worse costs in some other area. Even in jurisdictions like the US, where people are sometimes simply left to fend for themselves, the cost of homelessness by far exceeds the cost of housing people and paying for the staff that would care for them. The problem is that it is hard to get political support for such programs, and so the problem remains.

Ok.... everyone has their opinion on what the church needs. 

But the the thing is, people do not know what they want. see Malcom gladwell's Ted talk on spaghetti sauce. If you ask people what they want, they will almost never tell you the a curate thing they want (because we suck at knowing ourselves). I think the biggest problem the church has is asking what the members want and then giving them exactly that. In the 90s, Gen x asked for the rock concerts. The church gave it to them. Melinials asked for free coffee, to wear jeans. They gave it to us. Now "we" are asking for liturgy. I think giving it to us would only be continuing a long path of confusion.

What do Melinials actually want? Well, it is up to the church to anticipate needs. 

This is my opinion: operate like a university. Reduce the music time. Reduce the sermon time. Take out any chanting. Take out any jargon that isn't immediately followed by an explaination.  Make half of it q and a. If the pastor says something wrong, make it ok for the congregation to raise their hands and say so, during the sermon. Invite college professors in to moderate, different ones every time. Have guest speakers from different churches to challenge thought. Have guest speakers from different religions. Have members of the congregation tell stories of their hardest times and how they got through it. Have licensed therapists on staff. Have a legit clinic. Have ways of coping with mental illness. Invest in smart giving to the community... not fly by night missionaries or hustler "homeless" that rip off every church. 

Have young professional networking meetups. Promote everything local, don't focus on Africa or other things the church does not understand. 

Lean into the real hardships of life, don't sugarcoat it with stained glass but also provide positivity. Don't feel super happy cultish.

I'm conflicted. I grew up in Mexico, where we were told not to give money to beggars and the homeless because it would keep them on the streets or in the payroll of criminals employing child labor. I now live in the US and seeing how little government support there is for the homeless and mentally ill makes me feel so terrible ignoring them. These people live a daily hell and I'm not sure if giving them $5 really makes any difference for them or if it makes things worse...

For what it's worth I highly doubt she was schizophrenic. I had to live with her for three months or so, in that time many mentally ill people came and went from the homeless shelter. She was one of the stable ones.

Just because someone is mentally ill doesn't mean they are violent or dangerous.  Also, if you have young kids you would understand that they don't tend to have the same inhibitions and social prejudices that the rest of us develop over a lifetime and don't hesitate to ask awkward questions in situations where the rest of us would likely shy away.  I don't see any harm in it, they are just satisfying their curiousity.  

Homeless people are no more dangerous than anyone else you might meet on the street, and there's a (largely unfounded) stigma attached to mental illness that we need to actively work to eliminate.

Institutions can be shitty, but only when they are allowed to become so through neglect. The backlash against them started in the 1960s and 1970s based on some very real and appalling stories from specific institutions, but then a cost-cutting movement seized on this as an opportunity to shut 'em all down. But compulsory treatment and institutionalization are the only real option for the severely mentally ill and chronically homeless. Their illness will often have led them to fear and reject voluntary treatment or government support, and until it is treated they will remain homeless. 

Ideally, sure, their family and community would take care of them, and no that would not be a 'drain on the economy.' It'd be cheaper than institutions! Hell, ideally they would not be mentally ill in the first place. In the real world though, they are likely homeless because they have no family or have destroyed their ties with them in some fashion. In the real world, are you going to let your schizophrenic uncle stay with you after he's refused meds and perhaps threatened violence against you? Do you routinely invite street people in your community to come and stay with you?

Yep, I've been psychotic a few times and never sectioned. Usually I get so paranoid I don't step out, or I'm so overwhelmingly interested in something that the interest stops me for doing other reckless things, if that makes sense.... Painting/drawing on paper that spreads to the walls, etc. I've been cutting grass and seeing only dead soldiers and blood where the grass blades were, weeping uncontrollably for the poor grass. Receiving messages from space, believing the government was watching me from the TV, etc., etc. Never sectioned, even after a suicide attempt. Where I live it's particularly hard to stand out as strange though. Rather like being mentally ill in Glasgow I expect, you have to go that extra mile.
(no offence to Glaswegians)

There have been a couple of moments my wife has locked me in a room while she hides knives, ropes, belts, etc., but they were more mixed states.

I too believed I was the next Buddha, went around stripping off and handing my clothes and shoes to homeless people. Weird. That all stopped in my late twenties, and I sort of feel guilty for losing it - like I lost my spirituality, something I thought made me very special, and now I'm soul-less to some extent.

Despite many psychotic and delusional periods, and associated hallucinations at times, I'm counted as bp2 "because I've never been hospitalised". Treatment has relied on lithium, Depakote and Quetiapine. I'm up way more than down.
I don't mind though, there's probably less stigma with bp2, and the treatment involves the same set of drugs. I'm just glad I'm never getting SSRI's again.

They should move all the homeless services to one area of town so the homeless can have ease of access to services and to keep track of the individuals in the community. Never forget the homeless are people too who have their own stories. Most individuals who are homeless and living on the street have mental illnesses. So the real question is how do we provide them with access to services and treatment to get them off the street? You can't put a band-aid on this problem....

usually it means they are trapped in a cycle of poverty and living very precariously day to day.  and expecting these people to just be able to drop a deposit on an apartment and pass a background check at the turn of a dime is naive, and being homeless is a factor in stress and stress is a cause of many mental illnesses.  however the word "chronic" isn't strictly limited to medical conditions, shocking i know.

&gt;I would rather spend my tax dollars rehabilitating drug addicts and the morbidly obese than simply resuscitating

You realize drug addicts don't usually collect government handouts, specialized door frames, motorized scooters, and copious amounts of medical bills from literally making their livers into foie gras?

Can people realize that stuffing drug addicts and mentally ill, in the same category as gluttons who choose to eat insane amounts of (expensive) food daily is *wrong*? 

It's like saying "well you care about the poor homeless drug addicts on the street, so you should care about people living comfortably on everyone else's dime, sometimes better than those who work their entire lives, choosing to eat whole pizzas (for a snack) to themselves because they're sad about something." Like a sad attempt to make people feel sorry for them. 

Promise you the junkie is going to have a shittier quality of life and less resources to get help. Not to mention their states of mind to even reach out for it.

Does being fat make people sad and anxious? Yeah, and I'm sure it only gets worse the fatter you get. But holy shit, every time you make the wrong decision, it has to be on *you*, society can't afford for half of us to be helpless adult children.

He very probably has a mental illness. According to the [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration](http://homeless.samhsa.gov/ResourceFiles/hrc_factsheet.pdf) 26.2% of all people in homeless shelters on a given night suffer from mental illnesses; having worked at a resource centre for homeless people, I can tell you that among those who do not use shelters for whatever reason, their incidence of mental illness is generally substantially higher.

I deeply respect your ability to not take it personally and keep your composure when someone is spouting vitriol at you. I've been on the receiving end of angry people with schizophrenic disorders before, and I know that it can really be hard to hold yourself back from an angry response.

I know how i treat the homeless, and I feed them, too. I give money out of every paycheck to help them, and there are people who do a shit ton more than me. 


People treat panhanlders like shit, cause a lot of them aren't actually homeless or destitute and its hard to know which is which. also, the homeless can be fucking awful. Someone shits in the alley around the corner of my home. Its not a dirty alley. Its the access to a lot of actually pricey places to live. Its not a dark alley between two buildings. Its pretty open and nice. I have to walk in that alley failry often and at least one week out of the moth there is just a disgusting smell and a huge amount of shit. Human shit, no mistaking. This is right on the sidewalk, not in like bushes. 

Here are some other things I have witnessed hte homeless doing in the past two years alone (since Ive moved to the city).

1. Publicly masturbating (not even on the subway, like a normal pervert)
2. Pissing on a public street into a garden display with no shame (this guy was definitely mentally ill, he was HUGE and kind of scary)
3. Pissing on the floor of a 711 (the dude smelled like urine, and he start pissing himself. He didn't act like he realized, it might just be something he did) -- actually, this is a lie. This happened more than 2 years ago, porbaly more like 4. But in the area I live in now, and I think its funny so ill leave it.
4. Multiple episodes of being acting extremely hostile for no reason.

There are areas where they piss and it always smell like pee, as well. Not out of the way places, and in an area where there is access to public restrooms. The homeless aren't little angels that cause no problems. A lot are assholes. Its not just nice homeless people. Its not really all that unreasonable that people don't want to be pestered by panhandlers or deal with people acting hostile, or digusting.

I say this as someone who devotes half of all my charity to feeding the homeless (the other half goes to planned parenthood, I like to tell myself its paying for abortions cause thats what I really wish I was doing. I rally wish low income women had free access to abortions, it would really eliminate a lot of problems in society). 

also, in my city, when it gets really cold there are lots of services to help the homeless. Hotlines you can call to get help out to them. A lot of the time you can't help the homeless, though. Things like mental illness take a lot of resources and cooperation. Still, Id argue enough isn't being done, but I don't feel some african goat herders can criticize us.

Africans might not understand cause the crazy people they see here just die in africa or get locked up by their families. I guarantee we treat them better. we also support african countries, too. we help poor in other countries.

Either a planetarium / board game cafe hybrid for the mentally ill homeless people or a factory to manufacture more buses, subways and Marxist literature.

No, dying of an incurable disease, being kidnapped and forced to fight in a war zone, being sold into sex slavery, being mentally ill and homeless, etc. are hard. Eating a caloric deficit is easy as hell. You can do it while sitting on your fat ass.

&gt;homeless mentally ill vs. Unionized ttc worker.

Nobody is siding with OP so it looks like the unionized worker wins today. OP should probably get checked in to a hospital to have that mental illness looked at.

We own a condo in Santee Village- 2 blocks from Skid Row. I've watched my empathy for Skid Row's residents slowly get sapped away over the past couple years.  Maybe it was seeing all the harassment my wife has endured. Maybe it was that time a homeless drunk guy kicked my 10 lb dog for no apparent reason as we walked by him. Maybe it was those 3 separate times friends of mine were physically assaulted by homeless individuals. Or the never-ending parade of friends and neighbors that gave Downtown a try but in the end had enough and had to leave. Maybe it was those times that we had to call security because we found yet another erratic, mentally ill homeless person that had snuck into our building, wandering the halls and checking for unlocked doors. Or hell, I don't know...maybe it was just catching another person pissing or shitting in the entranceway of our building too many times. Take your pick.

Live here long enough and you will find your empathy being replaced with a sense of self preservation and a sad realization that you've probably made a very bad mistake bringing your family here. But I'm sure you know all that already, right?  After all, if you are in a place where you can objectively call my viewpoint "the worst fucking attitude", than clearly you must also live adjacent to Skid Row as well, right? Otherwise, you'd just be talking out of your ass.

Is this Christian damage control, blaming atheists for this when the article didn't mention a single thing about atheism?

EDIT: 

Do you associate atheism with liberalism because it explains your rampant stupidity?

-
&gt;Because she is a traitor. Virtually every anti-war movement in the US is organized and financed by the enemy the country is currently fighting and has been that way for almost a hundred years. It is where the term "Useful Idiots" originates from.

-
&gt;You're talking to a woman who is already a single mother and pregnant once again. Do you honestly think she takes care of herself or expects the rest of us to do it. On welfare to pay for her litter and ordering pizza to get the right sized ice she likes to chew. Yet another parasite to society.

-
&gt;More proof that liberalism is a mental illness and an anti-white male hate group.

&gt;Global Cooling, no wait - Gobal Warming, I mean Sudden Climate Change, I mean just Climate Change. See, I programmed a computer - us scientists call that a "model", and even though every single prediction it has made has been completely wrong it is science and the debate is over. You have to remember that for all of time science has been a methodology but now it all of a sudden an ideology. "Now give me a trillion dollars and stop economic development for a century and in a hundred years the average temperature will be 1/10 of one degree cooler" (this is the actual claim of the IPCC) you goddamn Denier. Burn the witch!

Can you find something that gives you purpose? You mentioned having a good income - could you financially support a charity in your area? I am a huge advocate of supporting homeless and mentally ill youth - is there a mentorship program nearby that you could support, either financially, or with your physical participation? As someone who has 'made it' as such, while still struggling with these feelings of hopelessness, you in turn could provide hope to kids who feel like they have no future.

I tried being a shitlord and posted this on the page, but apparently SJWs love being censor happy. (I got banned from the event)

&gt;I thought this event was satire, but apparently it isn't. With that in mind...

&gt;I've seen these type of arguments rise up from time to time, but with "patriarchy" instead of the Greek system. Likewise, the tenets of these arguments are fairly similar: 

&gt;1) "patriarchy" / Greek system is racist towards PoC (People of Color, whatever you want that to mean. White is a color last time I checked). Several individuals have posted here saying that the Greek system is not in fact racist, but rather welcoming and nurturing. But by responding with "#notallgreeks" or the like, if you find one anecdote that supports your position, whether true or false, then we cannot proceed. After all, we can only speak for ourselves, so why not find the problematic persons individually rather than knocking on the doors of the nebulous Greek system as a whole?

&gt;2) The whole concept of definitions. Generally, dictionaries contain both the historical definition of a word and also the modern, colloquial definition. For example, "literally" means "in a literal manner or sense; exactly" but also has a secondary definition that mirrors "figuratively". Likewise, the generally agreed upon definition of racism, both historically and colloquially, is contained within the dictionary. That is, until the general, colloquial changes.

&gt;3) Privilege. After all, this is what this party is about, right? I'd be lying if I said everyone was absolutely equal. Some of us are more disadvantaged than others. However, not all privilege can be seen on the outside. Some of us may have problems back home, others mental illness that cannot be seen. But just because a person looks like they have more privilege doesn't mean they do, and regardless of privilege, their arguments are not immediately invalid. Likewise, just because someone is underprivileged doesn't mean any arguments of theirs are automatically valid. Look at me for instance. If you know my background, I grew up in Bellevue in an affluent community. You may jump to conclusions and say that I'm privileged and therefore do not know the struggle of minorities. But this past summer, my entire family, minus my brother and I, had to move back to Korea due to visa issues. This past year was difficult; not only was it my first year at the UW, but I had to be my family's legal liaison, working at my parent's store to compensate for their absence. Hence why comments such as "oh you're asian you don't know the struggle of *real* minorities" irritate me.

&gt;4) "Educating". My main issue with proponents of this event comes around to this. It kind of reminds me of the nebulous nature of Scientology. Ask any Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Atheist, etc. to describe what they believe, and you'll usually receive a satisfying, succinct answer in a minute or so. However, like Scientology, proponents of this event are refusing to move beyond surface level explanations. When members of the Greek system are genuinely concerned and curious as to why this event is necessary, and get answers of "educate yourself white shitlord" or the like in response, they're not wrong to be mildly frustrated. Even those annoying guys in red square are vocal about what they believe in (however crazy such ideas might be), unlike several people on this page. What would happen if the Mormon missionaries said "I'm Elder John, and you should educate yourself heathen"?

&gt;5) The idea that "whites are never minorities, and blacks are always the minority". This may be true in some times in some places, but not always. Also note how this conveniently leaves out members of other races and those of mixed origin. If you really want a place where "black privilege" exists, then I'll point you towards the wonderful land of Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe accuses his opposition (some of them former colonists) of being promoters of white imperialism. As such, he promoted law banning whites from owning any lands and businesses, and redistributed them to native blacks, without any compensation to the former owners. Yet I hear no outcry about this, and why is that?

&gt;This post is way too long, so I'll end this with a "Go Dawgs!"

&gt;TL;DR: Check your privilege /s

It's in Brazil, from what I remember. The homeless person had no idea their back looked like that, they just said their back hurt. Probably lots of mental illness at play when someone lets it get this bad.

I'm someone who feeds the homeless quite a bit. I never give them money, but I buy extra food and hand it out. Look most of these guys have mental illnesses or have just flat out gave up on life. I've offered some to stay and if they need any help. But they're not interested. Most, not all, just want some money for glue or booze. That's there happy place.

Edit: Wow, thank-you so much for the Gold, but honestly more of us should do this. If you're walking in town and go to the bakery or something, especially in winter, just buy a few extra and hand them out to those who need them. Usually helps them sober up a bit and sends the message that society still cares.

Like mugenhunt said. Homelessness is a social problem that we largely created ourselves. In the 1980s, deinstituionalization happened where we removed severely mentally ill people from mental health hospitals. Granted, the institutions were horrible in the 50s, but it was an overreaction because the institutions were becoming much more humane by that point. 

Just pushing mentally ill people on the streets, of course, didn't make them any more able to survive, hold a job and get a place. So they're homeless. And a lot are also drug users or alcoholics. It's a form of self-medication. Using drugs and alcohol is something some of them do to run from their symptoms.

[In the 2010's many homeless are actually sober, drug-free people who want jobs but fail to get them](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/employment.html). In decades past, yes, maybe drug addiction, alcoholism, and mental illness were the primary factors. Times have changed.

I don't need to kick people when they are down to feel better about my MIT degree or my six figure salary. I just need a little empathy and the realization that not everybody had the advantages I lucked out with.
