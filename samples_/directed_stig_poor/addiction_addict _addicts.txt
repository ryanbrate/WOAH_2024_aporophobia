Some people are homeless due to mental conditions other than drug/alcohol addictions.  Ex-military are very prevalent in homeless populations due to PTSD.  Get off your judgemental high horse and drop the assumptions that all homeless are addicts.

Seems to me like the homeless guy Tony had to at least know more than he was telling, even if he wasn't directly involved.  Its interesting that the cops were relatively quick to rule out the idea that Tony was somehow involved.  Perhaps he told police some sort of info that has not been released to the public, for example what did Tony and Adam speak about outside the diner while Adam was there with Harold?  
Also, the strange behavior such as staying out late and burning his hand I would think indicates drug use, probably not out of the question to think that Tony may have gotten Adam into drugs (or maybe even taken advantage of his already existing addiction).  Although if he had met some sort of foul play due to drugs I would think his cash would have been stolen as well.

Talking about being homeless or being homeless because of drug/alcohol addiction?

Careful, you are getting dangerously close to the "I'm better than you are, because I care about the homeless and you are all just heartless bastards!" - and that is just plain status seeking, period.

If I was in "their shoes", I would have to be insane or have a major drug problem.   And I would hope rather than someone giving me $5 to spend on yet more crack, that they would petition their Congressman to re-open the mental institutions and drug treatment centers so I could get off the street.

Homelessness is not some random event that can just hit anyone, due to economic "bad luck".  The root causes are well known.

And handing out cash to people on the street is about the worst way to go about fixing the problem.   For drug addicts in particular, it is CRUEL, as you are enabling their habit.

Altruism can be very evil.  Usually it always is.

But some folks like to pump up their importance by saying they are "compassionate toward the homeless.." or whatnot.

It is just status-seeking behavior.  No different than the guy who says, "I'm better than you because I drive a Lexus.."

So examine where you are going with this.

**EDIT:** I have worked at several different shelters: one for families, one for adults, and one for 16-22 year olds. 

At the family shelter, we started out allowing people to stay for 4 months but had to increase it to 6 months because of the difficulty they had with finding housing or employment. All of the families received benefits from the state because of the kids, and they were required to save a certain percentage of their income to go towards an apartment. Even with that requirement, 6 months was frequently not enough time. Especially since many of them had lousy rental histories.  

At the adult shelter, it was even harder. The family shelter had a lot of families who were just down on their luck due to a bad economy, or not enough of a support system, or domestic violence. These families had an easier time saving money, and most had jobs already and a good rental history. At the adult shelter, most of the clients had histories of mental illness and addiction. Most were not employed and/or virtually unemployable without a LOT of time and effort and training. Most had some form of criminal record which in some cases meant that no one would hire them. Most had horrible rental histories which meant that no landlord would offer them an apartment. 

**If you are going to open a shelter, you need to understand that it isn't enough to just give someone a place to stay for free for 2 months so they can get back on their feet. You need to *actively* provide resources for them so they can learn how to do the things that come so easily to those with homes.** Job training, budgeting, addiction services. You would need community partners who might be willing to hire someone with a difficult background, or rent to someone with a bad history. 

I have more to say but this is enough, I think. Sorry about the book.

The homeless are homeless because they like the lifestyle or have a mental illness. There are plenty of government programs to get people off of the streets, this isn't the US or India. I never give money to homeless people directly, they just spend it on alcohol (gotta get those 2000 calories a day somewhere), cigarettes or drugs. Giving them money may make you feel like a good person, but I say it's doing them a disservice. 

If you really want to help them, consider donating to organisations that work with the homeless, drug and alcohol addiction or domestic violence. Buying a copy of The Big Issue is also OK if you want the instant gratification of helping someone.

EDIT: I'd like to point out that I don't dislike homeless people, as my third sentence may suggest. If I was in a shit situation I'd probably lean on substances myself, there's no shame in not being made of steel.

well because i'm kinda addicted to (benzos) and know how it feels to be a outsider of society ( as a transgender it wasn't always easy for me and isn't) plus he was homeless and a migrant ( he wants to quit stuff but doesn't get morphine and medicare here) and asked me for a place to rest(plus he was beat down on street and showed me the bruises)

We first stayed the whole day together and spoke openly. i told him i was a bit afraid to let him sleep at my place and he told me he would leave if i say so. and i'm 100% sure he would have done 

most addicts and homeless loose all hope and faith in humanity and maybe i just wanted to give him a hand and an open ear. (he told me a lot, about his kids(showed me pictures from him prior of the abuse and leaving of his home; his kids and his (ex-)wife)



btw at all: sorry for the late responses

Ok Thanks for explaining this to me. The link I make might seem too simplistic, yes. Perhaps I should say some mental "disorders".  I question what disorder even means including the phrase "lost their mind".  I do acknowledge that the brain is an organ and is complicated.   I  see creativity is sometimes channeled well through people and sometimes things go awry. So those are the people I'm talking about. I also wonder if the poorly formed or damaged ego is a factor, more than creativity and science in many cases. 

  It is fine that you are not into yoga. 

Oh and this : 
"It feels like in your posts, you're telling us that if creatives/homeless people/addicts have that link between mind-body-spirit, a lot of mental and other problems can be helped or cured. "

I'm actually not suggesting that.  I am suggesting this lack of connection idea, to help us be more compassionate or empathetic even, to the states of mind of creative people. A person who has "lost their mind" has clearly lost the connections to other parts of their experience. And yes, for some, no amount of yoga breathing can help. I am talking about the ones that can be helped.   

Again, thanks for these thoughts and making me think. I'm new to Reddit.

If you just look at the distribution ranges for IQ all of this crap makes perfect sense. More men at the top fields, like CEOs, senators, and STEM because there are far more highly intelligent men then women. And at the bottom far more homeless, drug addicts, and prisoners are men because there are far more low intelligence men then women.

This fucked up idea that is infecting our post modern retard society that women should be gifted the top jobs because they are "structurally oppressed" is so stupid that I end up immediately questioning the intelligence of anyone who supports it.

Yet you mention these FACTS, like Larry Summers did, and you will be fired for acknowledging the truth.

Women are just average in intelligence mostly.  Everyone needs to accept it. It's a fact.

The food thing is misleading, thats mostly for grains (a bread and water diet is betting then nothing, but not ideal), and theres also the problem of distribution.

&gt;There are more empty houses than homeless people. 

Obviously not throughout the planet. Most long term homeless have an addiction/mental illness and housing them will just make the house a drug den/get destroyed.

&gt;They then gamble with all our money and when they fail, they get rescued by the government with more of our money.

No stop it, dont conflate the banks with all corporations.

They probably didn't stop because they assumed he was a transient. Most of us see so many homeless people every day that we assume someone is homeless if they are at all dirty, disheveled, etc. Not that homeless people don't need a hand, but there's only so much you can do when it's a long term problem like addiction or mental health issues.  It's pretty horrible that we've gotten used to ignoring those who are obviously not okay.

Yea, totally with you on campus carry. I rode a bicycle to school 5 miles each way through a really nasty area of town. Like getting chased by unleashed dogs, homeless crack addicts living under some of the bridges, an area of town with a really high rate of violent crime. The university said that keeping one stored in a vehicle with a valid CHL is acceptable if parking on campus. But where did that leave me? It isn't like I could just leave my bicycle in the parking area with a safe rigged up to it. 

I'd at least have liked to check it in at the University PD as my commute was probably where I encountered the most risk, but I think just being able to carry on campus would have been the most practical option.

How does having a meth, crack, or heroin addiction lead to living a simple existence and avoiding the rat race?  How could you possibly come to that conclusion?  You could casually smoke a bowl of marijuana per day which equates to about $4 a day and then work a part time job and make enough to pay bills and live a chill life.  Addicted to the other drugs you named will have you homeless in no time.  Nobody comes home after working a shift and kicks back and smokes meth to relax, ffs.

&gt; there are objective standards for quality of life that are separate from how happy a person feels about their situation.

Agreed.  But the standards don't have to be drug free and working your ass off 40 hrs a week, pounding coffee and alcohol to cope.

I can only speak from personal experience, and I'm relatively new to shooting up, although I've been using opiates for a couple of years now, but *for me*, at this point, I'd say it's been worth it. Put simply, I absolutely love the high (which is indescribable... although I don't know that I'd compare it to a sexual orgasm), and think it's worth the risk.

I mostly credit my enjoyment of these drugs to the hard work I put in to **keep my tolerance low.** I do this for a number of reasons. First is price. You'll be spending shitloads of cash in no time if you let your tolly spike. There are guys on this sub who need to shoot 5-6 grams of H just to get a nod going! That's hundreds upon hundreds, even thousands, of dollars... for a few hour high! No thanks. I've never even had that much H in my possession. It would last for months on my current schedule. With a habit like that your life is undoubtedly fucked. That's why so many junkies end up on the street. I want to enjoy my dope under a roof, thank you very much. Which brings me to my last and most important reason for keeping my tolly low, which is the high. **It defeats the purpose if you let your tolerance spike.** You just won't be able to get high from amounts that used to have you nodding. That's my rationale: **I use the high I love as the antidote to it's addictive property.** That's how I've been able to successfully "chip" (use with breaks) thus far. Although I don't want to speak too soon, because no one is really in control. Even when my physical addiction is non-existent, my mental addiction is undoubtedly still there. Opis are the first thing I think about in the morning, and the last thing at night. But... while chippers are rare, they do exist. Right now, I'm living proof. I've heard junkies refer to us as "unicorns", and say that we should be in nature documentaries. I only hope that I can live up to that celebration. It's nice to know that I have *some* self-control... but who knows, with certain unfortunate turns in life, I might be one of the homeless dudes stealing so that I can shoot some monster amount just to stay well.

In terms of the other negatives and risks, my withdrawals have been relatively minor, and while I've nearly ODed a couple of times, they weren't unpleasant experiences for me. I came to feeling better than when I wake up in the morning (I was alone both times, so no narcan, luckily, which brings on instant w/ds). Death's a risk that comes with the territory. I mean, I'm scared of dying, like anybody else, but, like I said in my last post, an opiate OD seems like a relatively nice way to go.

Don't get me wrong, **I'm not saying to go out and shoot dope**, because that's how countless lives have been fucked up and lost (the stories on this sub are testament to that fact). I just don't think it's entirely negative for everyone, and everyone has the right to make the choice. But hey, maybe I'm just in denial. I mean, I'm obviously addicted... I just feel that it hasn't fucked me up too badly... yet. TBH a part of me says to cut my losses and run while I still can, but I don't see that happening any time soon. I took the last shot of one of my heavier binges about 24h ago (I'd been shooting on and off for a week prior), so I'm expecting some minor withdrawals over the next week or so. But I have comfort drugs to help me through it (particularly benzos and lope... and I prob won't even need the lope... there are countless w/d threads here... you can look up the benefits of those things if you'd like), so I don't think it will be any worse than a flu. I've never shot in excess of 75mg (of ~ok stuff, but usually quite a bit less *[EDIT: I should probably stress that "ok stuff" is actually pretty bad stuff most other places, as it's not cheap where I come from... usually what we get is only around 25-35% pure]*), so my habit is a baby by any junkie's standards.

So there you have it. That's my experience in a nutshell. I hope it's been of some interest to you. (A part of me obviously loves writing about this stuff... but I'm not the first junkie to navel gaze.) Feel free to check back with me in the coming days to see if I'm all talk, and I'll be happy to let you know how I'm getting along... well, maybe not "happy", as w/ds are **not fun**, but I'll tell you. :)

Edit: Man, even as weak w/ds are just barely coming on, I'll tell you that opiates are no joke, and you should keep your tolly very, very low (never shoot) if you're going to use at all. Is it worth it? Well, IDK, but wouldn't recommend it to someone who's contemplating the path, even at my early stage. If respected, these drugs can show you a heavenly high, but that can very quickly become hell... I've barely had a taste of it, and can already say that that outcome is *not* worth it.

I already talked about this. You dont decide not play sports because some people cheat, you dont play with the ones that are *found* to cheat. You are just judging a people by a minority by taking that stance. You also dont know that a criminal or fraud or any other unsavory type of person isnt eating the sandwich that your money purchased for the food bank.

Sometimes people dont need food. If I offered you a sandwich right after you ate you would say no too. By your admission, churches, governments, and food banks all help with homeless food ussues, right? Why then is it so hard for you to see that food might not be what they need? There are plenty of homeless people who eat but lack other resources.

I have a hard time seeing most homeless refusing a gift card (but this follows the point that it is not my position to judge them as frauds because I cant see their point of view) plus that argument makes little sense to the point anyhow... An addict or fraud trying to make money for a nefarious reason will just as easily sell a gift card or anythingto make their ends. In fact, I would be willing to bet that many homeless people who do accept your food, turn around and sell it to the ones who they know have food addictions or shortages. We would never use that as an excuse to stop giving food.

I think it is equally short-sighted to urge not to give money, not to help addicts, not to help criminals... They're called basic human rights for a reason. I judge those who oppose shelters built in 'their' neighborhoods, I judge those who oppose clinics and rehab facilities, and I judge those who think there is a valid reason people do not need cash assistance.

I live very close to the DTES and just gave two of my old smartphones to a couple that is homeless and trying to get their shit together. Having access to both devices and wireless is important. There are many services that have moved primary online...such as the Service BC Centers that have NO physical locations in Vancouver. So all those services that you speak about such as housing, mental health care, addiction services...etc. are often unattainable without a digital connection.

&gt; There are several assistance programs they can utilize to help themselves. 

These tend to be severely underfunded and do not actually fulfill the needs that most homeless people actually have. Finding access to these programs is also something that isn't as easy as you'd expect. I know where I should go because I've worked with homeless people, but some of my friends (who are a lot smarter than I am) wouldn't know what to do.

&gt; They'd rather be a alcoholic/drug addict that lives on the street than a recovering alcoholic/drug addict. 

Not true. As someone pointed out, being a recovering addict is hard enough and becomes significantly harder when you don't have a home. A lot of programs that help the homeless require someone to be clean, which really doesn't help anyone. Housing first programs are still not very common.

The [article in question](http://www.fraserinstitute.org/uploadedFiles/fraser-ca/Content/research-news/research/publications/practical-challenges-of-creating-a-guaranteed-annual-income-in-canada.pdf).

Section 1 and 2 give a summary of what they're evaluating, and overview the current nature of income support in Canada:

* They assume only a single, federally funded and administered GAI.  A decentralized, provincially administered and partially-federally-funded GAI is mentioned only as a footnote.

* They consider for integration into a GAI federally: OAS + GIS, CPP, EI, child tax benefit, universal child care benefit, federal transfers to social housing, WITB, GST/HST credit, age credit, child tax credit, pension splitting, pension credit, child care deduction and numerous smaller tax benefits.  Grand federal total: $132 bn.  Provincially: $38 bn in social assistance, and $11.2 bn in various income-supporting tax credits.  They estimate about $6 bn in local government expenditures.

* The grand total on income support by their metrics is $185 bn per year.  They note that if transferred to all individuals with incomes under $20,000 per year, it would amount to $17,273 per.

* This would amount to one of the largest governmental reforms in Canadian history, accounting for about a quarter of the government, by program spending.

* They note that boosting income rather than in-kind benefits offers more flexibility for recipients and enables them to make active choices to their benefit.  They also note that, if GAI replaces programs such as prescription drug coverage for the poor, it may actually be detrimental to some individuals.

* Basic income and severe addiction do not play nicely together.

* Canada's complex social assistance system at current makes it hard to navigate for the average citizen in need.

* OAS is the program most similar to a simple GAI, being unconditionally paid for almost anyone over 65.  Administrative costs for OAS are only 0.3% of the amount of transfers.  EI rises to nearly 9%.  Welfare in BC is more than 30%. This re-enforces the possibility of administration savings.  In general, there seems to be a correlation between the strictness of eligibility requirements and the % of expenditures spent on administration.

* They note that stricter requirements seem to reduce the number of people on benefits, and thus overall dependency on government transfers.

* Poverty is more complex than simply a lack of income, therefore one can't assume that a GAI would eliminate poverty.  This bodes poorly for the hope of eliminating all government bureaucracy and special programs.

* They note that the % of Canadians in chronic poverty over a multi-year basis is quite low.  Most impoverished Canadians move out of poverty rather than remain in it on a truly permanent basis.

* GAI does not address the underlying cause of a lower earning potential of demographics such the disabled, recent immigrants, single persons 45-64, etc.  One might expect many of these individuals to be little better off under a GAI than they currently are.

Section 3 is essentially a series of questions that don't have consensus and would need to be decided for implementation:

* They consider three basic kinds of implementation for a GAI: the negative income tax, a universal grant ("demogrant / basic income") and income top-up.  Each has its supporters, and each has its comparative drawbacks versus the other two.

* Even something as fundamental as the amount is controversial.  It should be generous enough for basic needs, and yet not so generous as to strongly discourage work.  Figures ranging from about $12,000 to nearly $40,000 are given.

* Should the amount be different for people in different circumstances?  What about dependent children, the disabled, the elderly? 

* Should transfers be based on households or individuals?

* Should it be based on regional cost of living?  Costs in Iqaluit, Windsor and downtown Vancouver are all very different.

* How aggressive should clawbacks be?  

* The cost of a GAI could vary anywhere from about $30 billion to $400 billion, depending on the specifics. (!!!)

Section 4 addresses political, legal and various other pragmatic barriers to implementing a GAI in Canada:

* Their biggest "objection", perhaps better characterized as resignation, is the jurisdictional quagmire that any GAI program would be bogged down in.  They conclude that cooperation between the 13 provinces and territories and the federal government for the implementation of a centrally administered GAI is not likely.

* The provinces would likely, in general, welcome federal expenditure in the area of income support, but some provinces would strongly oppose the elimination of CPP and employment insurance -- the two largest federal expenditures for income support, after OAS.

* They note that each specialized program would face substantial opposition from the segment of the population that benefits from it.  Implementing GAI would inevitably result in fighting advocates that want to protect programs that benefit the elderly, children, the disabled, immigrants, refugees, and indeed almost every other segment of the population.

* GAI would face numerous groups calling for small changes, often for, on an individual basis, reasonable and fair reasons.  If all of these are accommodated, the collective result could be a program just as monstrously bloated as the current system.

* Even if implemented in a fairly simple form, "patching" of the system would result in growth and complexity over time.

* CPP would be particularly complicated to dismantle.  What do we do with the assets currently in the portfolio?

* Every exception, extra rule, and program exempted from integration into the GAI detracts from one of the primary advantages of the GAI: administrative simplicity.

Section 5 deals with work disincentives:

* In short, some degree of reduction in labour force participation is nearly certain.  The actual degree, and in particular, the degree to which people reduce hours vs. completely drop-out, is uncertain.

* The experimental evidence is unsatisfactory, as all programs were ultimately temporary and thus participants were unlikely to make permanent life decisions on the basis of the program's existence.

* They note that the current system, however, already has strong work disincentives for the poor.

My own thoughts/criticisms:

* In general, this report is written from the perspective of optimizing government expenditure in terms of reducing abject poverty as a % for dollar value.  While this sort of analysis is indeed important, it's also ultimately just a little bit heartless.  Compassion, security and social justice are hard to quantify in dollar values (though it can be attempted), yet most consider them quite important policy goals.

* If a federal GAI is unconstitutional on the basis that the federal government has no role in the direct administration of social welfare, then aren't the child credit and especially the WITB unconstitutional?  If not, why can't the GAI be legally structured in the same way as the WITB and work as part of the tax system (basically a NIT).

* While fitting with the spirit of federalism, they don't consider the possibility of the federal government coercing the provinces into compliance with transfer payment conditions.

* Some provinces have a program that administers the assets of people who are mentally incapacitated in some way..  It has the power to impose a budget.  Why not expand this to cover people that, e.g. end up homeless after blowing their GAI?  It's paternalistic to some degree, but certainly better than forced institutionalization, or frankly, even the current conditions associated with welfare in most provinces.

* While it's true that strict requirements reduce overall dependency and reduce government costs, strict requirements also harm many people in genuine need of assistance.

* For people on the low end of the income scale, while it's true they often temporarily cease to be severely impoverished, there is little long-term security.  It's common for cycles of employment/unemployment to lead to cyclical periods of poverty (which, I would note, the FI's report conveniently considers not to count as "chronic poverty" when giving their numbers like 3% of Canadians living in chronic poverty over a 6 year period).

* Things like drug coverage and assisted-living supports for those on social assistance should not be cut to fund a GAI -- they should integrated into universal health care and be made available to all.

* Most proposals for GAI seem to call strongly for concurrent reform of taxation.  The net effect is a change to government policy so drastic that the end result is unpredictable.  It seems likely that GAI would require many years if not decades before all the "kinks" (which would have drastic effects on the lives of the poor) are ironed out.

* Most of the reduction in workforce participation in the GAI studies done so far was in the number of hours and did not result in people dropping out of the labour force altogether.  The few populations that did drop out were arguably beneficial: mothers staying home with children, people opting to complete high school rather than commencing work at 16, etc.  While reduced working hours would have complex economic ramifications and could reduce GDP somewhat, it's also a question of values rather than simple economic optimization.  Since the 40 hour work week, there has been little reduction in the number of hours worked.  In the end, we work to live, not live to work.  Is it worth having a slightly poorer country in exchange for less inequality and more leisure time?

* While the authors incidentally cite studies that show that income stability is strongly beneficial to health, they ultimately don't acknowledge that simple security is one of the most compelling benefits of a GAI.

Its because people in this city seem to expect the homeless to disappear once they wind up on the streets. Most of them have such tragic stories that have led up to their crippling addictions, or complete financial losses. It really breaks my heart to see them get treated so callously by the majority. They have just as much of a right to exist as anyone else. They might not be dressed in the newest clothes, or have cars or homes, but theyre humans and at one point they had families and were cared for. Have some empathy for fuck sakes.

I think that might be a big part of it too from what I gathered. A friend of mine is currently going down the path of addiction, which is why I thought to ask here. 

He had a job and was stable and had a lot of friends until his new gf got him into doing cocaine. When I first heard about it he still was OK and it didn't seem to interfere with anything. Then it slowly went downhill.

 He lost his job, his friends tried getting him to quit but he wouldn't. He started stealing their stuff and lost the friends and eventually had to move in with the gf (who was selling her body for drugs) then they lost their place and just recently moved South with their income tax. They got kicked out of the friends house down there for stealing again. And had to move back here and are in the homeless shelter. 

All that happened since November or so, when he got with the girl.

Please look at this from the child's perspective. You suddenly appeared one day, a month later you married her father. Now it's 3 months in and she still barely knows you. It takes time to earn trust and affection. Does she know you want kids soon? That's a threat too. 

You said you were basically homeless and he took you in. Now you're wondering why and why things are rough. Gosh, I hope you're not the same newly clean addict who posted a few months ago that she was getting married to a man she'd just met and was struggling with the step daughter then. I think pretty much everyone who posted said it would take time and rushing wasn't a good idea for anyone involved. 

Your husband needs to hold your hand AND her hand. He needs to put both pictures up. But you need to have compassion for this child whose life has been so drastically altered.

You're not posting facts. You're repeating things other people said. Nothing else.

Most inner-cities have multiple resources for the homeless. Unfortunately, a lot (not all) of homeless have addiction issues, mental health issues, or both and they don't want help. You can try forcing it on them, and you may have some success in the beginning. But most will revert back to old behaviors. 

Story time: A few years ago, this church in the city of Camden NJ (where I work) tried to put the homeless living in one of Camden's tent cities into suburban hotel rooms miles from the city during the cold winter months. It failed miserably. They were forced out of the lifestyle they're accustomed to and were given a set of rules to follow. The police in surrounding neighborhoods started finding homeless men and women wandering down major highways towards Camden. It was a huge problem for a while. 

TL;DR - not all homeless people want help. They've grown accustomed to a lifestyle full of addiction and lack of structure. 

Edit: I don't work for the aforementioned church. I do work in the city though.

Sorry this post ended up being long-winded, but I feel like I can relate and that I've broken out of "the bubble". I'll start by saying that I think this thread is indicative of the fact that you have a ton of potential - certainly more than you realize. You want more, and that's the seed that gets the ball rolling.

I was in a similar boat a few years ago. I'm introverted and prefer my alone time; nothing wrong with that. But I'm pretty self-critical have deep-rooted anxiety and depression from something that happened when I was a kid, and that kept me down most of my life (and didn't particularly help with women, either).

I delivered pizzas to make money in college, and kept doing so after graduating while I tried to figure out what the next step was (I used the "tough job market" excuse sincerely, but it made me complacent and progressed into an easy excuse to sit in my room playing Xbox or watching sports or political shows in my off hours). That in and of itself didn't make me miserable - the lifestyle wasn't particularly challenging and I could feed my video game addiction - but eventually I realized that I had it way too easy (and was way too content) for a 23-year old who had an open-ended college degree and was still delivering pizzas. No one had any issues with me, as far as I can tell (I've always been the "nice guy"), but eventually the realization that I was happy having accomplished absolutely nothing started to eat away at me.

I started looking into ways to get out, which began (in April-ish 2011) with using some of the money I'd saved to spend a few days in the UK (during the Royal Wedding; it sounded like fun). I'd always wanted to go, and instead of letting excuses get in the way, I adopted a "why the hell not?" mentality and was in London a few weeks later. That trip was liberating!

The London trip was expensive, but I took a couple more "why the hell not?" trips that year that were a little more cost-effective - the last space shuttle launch in Titusville, FL and Jon Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity" in D.C with a couple friends. Those experiences convinced me that life is really what you make of it - there was nothing stopping me from doing those things but myself.

Not long after, I decided I needed to get the ball rolling on making my life "purposeful" (my own standard), so I started looking at ways to go about that. I eventually applied to Peace Corps and began volunteer-tutoring K-12 at a local library (6 hours/week) and teaching ESL to immigrants who wanted to improve their job prospects (4 hours/week).

Fast forward a year (the Peace Corps application process takes forever), and I was in 8000 miles away in Tanzania to teach high school-level health in a village with no electricity or running water. I used my personal dissatisfaction (from not having accomplished anything to that point) as a motivating factor, and ended up having a highly successful service. (In fact, it was so successful that Johns Hopkins asked me to extend for a year with them. I'm still volunteering, but I'm doing what I love and my resume looks pretty awesome to boot; I'm looking at grad school next year at either Hopkins or Emory.)

If you'd have told me any of this in early 2011, I absolutely wouldn't have believed it.

So that's me; back to you...

Obviously you're dissatisfied with where you're at. And (most important) you recognize it. Great! As far as I'm concerned, that's potential fuel for getting yourself out of "the bubble".

One of the best things anyone's ever said to me is "you can't choose what life throws at you, only how you choose to react to it" - I don't know who said it originally, but it's a common quote and exists in a number of variants. I'd heard it a number of times before, but one time in-particular was just the right moment for me, and it's stuck ever since.

To this point, you've chosen to deal with life's challenges by beating yourself up. You have a self-limiting attitude, which is just what it sounds like. This is not uncommon; I've been there myself, obviously, and it can be overcome!

Humility and being self-critical can be positive things (this may sound silly to you, but I'm actually reading it as you having a strong sense of integrity). But it can also be damaging if you start focusing disproportionately on the negatives, some of which may not even be flaws except for the fact that you're perceiving them as such. (For example, most women - not all, but most - care less about physical appearance than you seem to think; hygiene is the real key - if you shower once a day and wear deodorant, you're good. Also, while I hate generalizing, women typically prefer to be referred to as "women" and not "girls". How you think goes a long way in influencing your behavior, which is why attitude is so important.)

Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. You're not social; you don't have to be. Some people are, you and me and others aren't. You seem to focus a lot on your weaknesses - again, I've been there - but you should also consider your strengths. (For example, your punctuation and grammar suggest you're a strong writer. Your subconscious can beat yourself up all you like, but it also revealed some talent.)

**(See the bottom of this post; there's an exercise that might help.)**

Another important thing I recommend is taking ownership of your negative qualities. You may share negative qualities with members of your family, but they're still *your* negative qualities and you're responsible for changing them if you don't like them. Blaming your family appears to be a subconscious attempt to reinforce the belief that you can't change; don't limit yourself (easier said than done, granted, but it's on you to try)!

Finally, a more tangible suggestion (*and I think to most important practical advice I can give*): start doing something you think is "purposeful". For me, that was volunteering, so that's what I'd recommend to you. Find something you're passionate about - tutoring K-12, helping out at a homeless shelter or the local humane society, or something else that falls in line with what you think is important. A few hours a week isn't as long as it might seem on paper (and you'll probably add time if you find you enjoy it). It's a great way to build up your sense of self-worth, build up your resume and increase your self-confidence (which helps with women, of course).

Well, that was pretty long. Apologies again. But I do have to get back to work now. Hope everything works out!

**Oh yeah, that exercise I mentioned...**
I want to recommend a personal exercise that helps lay the groundwork for a better sense of identity. It's actually designed for small groups, but it's a cool one that I was introduced to last week while working on a behavior change module we're going to introduce in the next couple months. Your choice whether or not you choose to do it, but it's simple and harmless, so why the hell not?

The exercise: Think about someone you look up to - doesn't matter whether you know them personally or not. Once you've identified someone (or a couple people, if need be), think about what it is about them that you admire. Come up with three personality traits that they that most describe who you WANT to be (even if you don't currently have those traits). Then say out loud, "I am [those three traits]." Don't be afraid to boast!

I don't know if doing it alone will be as effective as it was when we demonstrated the module; it's designed to be spoken to other members of the group to get it "out there", rather than internalizing it. After identifying the traits, we asked participants to walk around and ask each other "Who are you?", following by the trait response ("I am intelligent, reliable and compassionate" was mine.)

If you want, feel free to PM me your three traits or even post it below in a reply for the world to see.

I could make a Craigslist ad saying "College female at this location wants literally anyone" and probably have way too many responses. Sex isn't a rare commodity only reserved for the hottest and the fittest and most successful. Hell, there are probably homeless elderly drug addicts that have more sex than I do. There's people who want to have sex with cars. Find a better example of your desirability.

That isn't the point. Your place of business cannot, under any circumstances, become a destination for the poor and homeless. For every poor family down on their luck trying to get shoes for their children there's a drug addict who will stab your employee if the trash doesn't contain what they wanted that day and they're having a bad trip. If they begin to congregate even a tiny bit, they start to scare away paying customers.

I understand why people feel that way, but you have to consider situations from every angle. A store might even donate some of their waste to charity, but they still can't have the homeless at their dumpster.

Wasn't there a documentary where they gave a homeless guy tons of money and he just went crazy and bought tons of things only to not be able to afford it in the end and ended up homeless again? A lot of them can't grasp the "working life" aspect or arnt fit for it. Drug addicts aren't gonna stop having problems with thousands of dollars handed to them.

Homeless addicts are less likely to value their own lives than people who are well off. I don't think that's open for debate. He gave access to drugs to people who had the resources to get help if necessary.

*Don't ever give homeless people money.* 

Most panhandlers are totally normal people. They come into the city and make 20-30 bucks a fucking hour preying on people's good nature. The rest are drug addicts and alcoholics. You want to help? Donate to a charity or a shelter. Overpay on your taxes. 
<TRUE,TRUE>

Same. Here in the UK the only people who sleep rough are those who refuse to forgo their addictions (usually heroin or alcohol) so they can use the homeless shelters and hostels.

Used to work for a fast food chain and there were a group of smack addicts who would sit outside and when folk bought them food they would come in and try and get a refund so they could get cash for drugs.

I fucking despise beggars and I would never buy or give them anything. Perhaps advice at a push. "Spare any change for the homeless?" My reply? "Change comes from within, buddy".

I'd encourage everyone interested in substance addiction—especially heroin—to check out the book Righteous Dopefiend. It's got a lot of photos like this, but all delves really thoroughly into the societal factors that impact heroin users' lives, and offers insight into systematic oppression against homeless drug users. 
<TRUE,TRUE>

Or the shelters are super dangerous. I know a lot of women will choose sleeping outside over a shelter because the rape rates at the latter are so high. 

And people with addictions are often barred from shelters as well, which totally makes sense considering the incredibly high rates of addiction among homeless people. 
<TRUE,TRUE>

I don't really care if the homeless guy I give money to spends it on booze or drugs. I would like for him to get clean, but addicts can't just quit then and there without physical repercussions, and I'm not some puritanical morality police. If I feel compassion for someone, and I have some small bills, sometimes I give that person some money.

Also, most charities (especially religiously affiliated ones) have terrible inflated overhead, and most of your money is going to be wasted. I don't want a goddam red cent of my money going to some homophobic asshole who's going to preach hate to his insipid congregation. Honestly I would much rather it be spent on drugs than donated to a church.

What is your view on the issue surrounding drug misuse / abuse? Do you believe the current system is fine as it stands or would you propose significant changes to the way drugs are seen and drug abusers are treated, examples of these changes that come to my mind are:

 The legalisation of minor lower class drugs with proper regulation and moderation, perhaps even taxation like we see on alcohol &amp; tobacco. 

A change in the way addicts / users are treated and/or punished in society, due to the prison system often leading users to find stronger drugs or return to drugs upon release from prison due to very little rehabilitation. Essentially treating addictions as a health problem and not a criminal issue. This could give law enforcement more time to focus on the larger suppliers / importers of dangerous drugs.

Think of it this way, how could that dude bring up the courage to drill arround in your teeth and shaping them with lasers and shit. I would probably puke in the patients face lol. Get over it, because fucking teeth &gt; almost everything. Its what differentiates you from a homeless person or crackhead. (no i dont think all homeless people are addicts)

I hate my parents. I'm 19 and have no friends or social life, and everyday I want to pack up and leave. The idea of being able to just roam the country, even if I was homeless, is so much more appealing that being stuck at home with a pair of emotionally manipulative, arrogant, controlling stress addicts who have no idea how to maturely handle a situation. But I worry about what my mother might do if I left, plus I have a dog and would hate to leave him with them.
<TRUE,FALSE>

And it's a little demeaning to the homeless as well, no? They're not animals in a zoo; they're human beings. It's weird to make a sign like "don't feed the fish!" I can't really explain *why* it feels so wrong, it just does. With not feeding an animal or whatever, we know it's in the best interest of that animal, so it doesn't get sick. With not giving money to a panhandler, it's sort of like saying that, no, we know what's best for them, it's not money, so put it here. Are they going to come back and help those specific people who didn't get money because of this sign?

Plus, it doesn't matter if they want money for new shoes, food, booze, or drugs. They're still people. And you know that they might not use your money in the way *you* think is best, but it's still your choice if you want to give them money. 49/50 people could go and use that money to fuel their addiction, but who cares? The money was given freely. I dunno, the sign just irks me.

Addiction is like a balloon - if I squeeze it in one area, the other areas get bigger!

I don't know you, but you admit to being a benzo addict who still gets high with alcohol and street drugs. It seems like you "squeezed" the benzo part of the balloon and the other areas  bulged out - the cocaine, the strippers, the drinking, etc. 

I'm really worried that you write, "[i]t doesn't affect my day to day life," yet you lost a girlfriend "due to this issue mainly" an you're "more easily irritated." Those sound like day to day issues to me. 

Any mind or mood altering substance can be devastating to my life. My story doesn't include cocaine, but I don't have to try it to know it's a horrible idea for me. I have plenty of "yets" in my story, and you probably do, too. I've yet to use certain drugs. I've yet to be homeless. I've yet to die from addiction, but all those things can happen. 

If I'm asking myself if I have a problem, I probably do. Normal folks don't wake up one morning and thing, "am I using too much dope?"

Ok but norway is leaps and bounds richer than the rest of the world in purchasing power. When you can make a living on minimum wage, you cant possibly understand how shitty it is to be 30k in debt halfway through your mandatory career path's university education, have 2 jobs but not working enough hours to move out, and almost zero medical insurance if i were to move out, no dental insurance, no eye insurance, even on my parents' plans, who both work and make decent money (read: combined, still 50k less combined than the average 1 person's wage in norway) and can barely afford to live in the house my mom and my grandma and i were raised in (i pay my own bills but just not rent if im in school)

And still you get looked at like youre a homeless crack addict for not living on your own. And still cant bring girls home unless she's your girlfriend because your mom wants to make friends and be judgmental at the same time. And you still cant even have w computer in your room because this is a family house. But at least you can afford gas money to drive to school for the degree that might never do anything for you! 

Sigh, sorry for ranting.

You should watch "through a blue lens" and gain some perspective on addiction.  Also most addicts are not homeless, and there is more than their addiction that caused them to get to that place.  Sure the addiction helped, but its not the whole story.

In my area it wouldn't work.  

When you look closely at the homeless who live outdoors in our cold winters despite there being emergency shelters open, you find people who have serious mental health and or addiction problems.   We cannot force someone to get mental health treatment or addiction treatment who doesn't want it.   Shelters aren't equipped to manage the behavior of the seriously (and untreated) mentally ill.  Shelters don't allow people to actively use drugs or drink, and the addict chooses his fix over a warm bed.  

I'd love to see a major overhaul in the mental health and addiction services.  I bet it's far cheaper to offer free good quality mental health services and free drug rehab than it is to police the crime caused, incarcerate these people,  and to suffer the harm their misbehaving causes on society.     

Right now a poor person having a major mental health crises goes to their local hospital er, stays long enough to be put on some medication to manage the behavior, and they're released.   No follow up for the meds.  No meeting with a therapist.  If the meds don't work that well, in a few months they'll be back in the er or jail.  If they do work, medication compliance is a huge problem: patient feels he's not sick any more and meds are expensive/inconvenient.  Patient stops taking meds, and the behavior degrades again. 

And even with insurance, patients have to deal with under served areas and waiting lists to get into rehab.   In my county if you're on medicaid the medical insurance carrier doesn't cover it.  It's handled by a mental health plan which contracts out one or or two clinics.    There might be a wait of a month for a new patients first appointment.    And if you're homeless (no addess) or not thinking clearly (mental illness/addiction) you're not going to have any coverage at all.

I don't want to get too far off track, but since you seem to be an expert  can you explain why people are homeless then? For example, if only a VERY tiny percentage of homeless people are drug addicts, then what is the cause? Are you saying that they are lazy and simply don't want to work instead? Are you saying perhaps they are all alcoholics? Please, to help me judge them more accurately state the major cause of homelessness, then stop to consider if that persons actions may have had any part of it.

I love how defensive he gets when people point out his ignorance or hypocrisy in situations.  He thinks all gays are going to hell and deserve no rights, he thinks all cops should be trigger happy, and he thinks all homeless people are lazy drug addicts.  He is the exact type of southern racist idiot I am the most scared of being stuck in a room talking to.

A lot of people don't naturally have empathy for people with different experiences than them. Look at all the people who assume poor people must have done something to deserve poverty. Then there are the politicians and public figures who will rail against X (abortion, homosexuality, addiction) until a relative reveals X and suddenly the person is making public announcements about how he now understands that people with X aren't monsters but need our support.  These people are probably warm and loving with people close to them, but make no effort to understand anyone outside their narrow experience until someone close to them forces the issue.  Having little or no empathy probably makes life seem more straightforward and easy to understand. I know it works that way with my sister, who sees things in very black and white* terms and ignores any factors beyond fallout from personal decisions. (*not racially -- she just doesn't do shades of gray or nuance.)

True, but some estimate up to 12% of America's homeless population are veterans.

http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics/

That's not booze, drugs, or any other addiction.  That's the US failing to support their troops after they're done serving.  I'd bet most of the homeless vets have PTSD or something similar that prevents them from functioning in society.  The VA needs to step up the level of care for our veterans.

Thanks for sharing your story, it's very brave of you. In the first place I never spoke about banning talking about drugs completely I suggested allowing it in a designated place, but I was at the disadvantage of never using What's forums to see the threads in question or knowing how the forum is structured.

Regarding my drug views I think one problem is children were told nothing but how awful drugs are, yet when they try them they feel absolutely amazing, most drugs are extremely enjoyable at first to say the least and some like crack or meth will feel like the most amazing thing they've ever done. After feeling so incredible many people feel like they've been lied to and that's why children need to be educated with the whole story, both good and bad.

Heroin for instance makes you feel very nice at first and there's not really any obvious downside as you won't rattle on the 1st occasion either. Barely anyone just tries it once however and after just 4 days you could already be physically addicted, and a rattle isn't like the flu as the doctors might tell you, it's MUCH worse and is not only agony physically, it destroys you mentally too to the extent that you'll feel like you can't cope with living for another 5 seconds, yet you'll have around 4 days before you even start feeling better. Once hooked on heroin your entire life will revolve around getting your next fix and you will be willing to sell or do virtually anything to get it. Many people who wouldn't have dreamed they were capable will resort to crime once addicted to heroin and once you are properly hooked you won't even be taking it to feel good any more, your body will simply need it just to feel "normal".

Another example is crack, take it just once and it's so nice that you'll think of nothing else but getting more of it, you'll spend all your money and sell everything to get it, nothing else will matter apart from taking it and long term commitments like going to work will seem much less important as long as you get your next hit now you'll skip work and worry about it later. After being hooked for a short while you will enjoy taking it less however and you'll be taking even more so you don't feel terrible when you're not taking it, also you'll experience more side effects that are sometimes reduced by taking other drugs like heroin for instance which will obviously make things much worse overall and you will very quickly go downhill to the gutter in every respect. If you say have rent money to avoid being thrown onto the street in your hand and no spare money you will spend it on crack and worry about being thrown on the street later, that is why so many drug addicts are homeless, it's less often the other way around where they take drugs after ending up on the street.

Regarding speed, people may think it's not that bad compared to herion, crack or meth, but I bet you really enjoyed it at first, it would make you feel alert and capable of doing almost anything with a lovely warm feeling at the same time. To cut a long story short, after a while you'd be taking more and more of it trying to feel the same, until eventually you find you're taking it just to get through a normal day and not to feel amazing any more, then when you don't take it you'd feel unbelievably fatigued and then the horrible depression sets in. Your sleep pattern would have been all over the place where you'd sleep for long periods, while staying awake at other times and it would become increasingly difficult to perform normal everyday tasks.

Another way of looking at narcotics is like going to a loan shark, except you borrow good feelings instead of money, later however you have to pay it back with lots of interest which can often be over a long period of time.

Edit: spelling / grammar mistake - changed a "you're" to a "your".
