&gt; The state has no business adhearing to people that are living off of it's system, either.

That sentence doesn't even make sense.

Randomized or not there is no such thing as a drug test that is 100% error proof.  The testing is done by human beings for a start.  

The fact that you think it's remotely reasonable to implement draconian government intervention in hair growth is sickening and absurd and excludes any value being placed in the human dignity of the people you claim you want to help (the majority of welfare recipients who are honestly claiming what they're entitled to claim).   And as for people with medical conditions that effect their ability to present sufficient hair they can just go screw themselves.  Hair or go starve to death.

No, no, nopity nope, and it's frankly sickening that you think money is worth that kind of draconian state intervention and that kind of attack on peoples' basic dignity and rights.  

As for reducing numbers by a long shot, that's based on your uninformed gut feeling about what feels truthy to you.  It's not based on the actual results from implementing drug testing on welfare recipients because those results actually suggest that welfare recipients are disproportionately unlikely to take drugs as compared to the general population.

That you want to have the state dictate hair growth and demand people give up the freedom to choose what to do with their own hair, and never mind the cost of basic human dignity and the normalization of over bearing state intrusion into deeply personal body issues, over some fanciful gut feeling that runs contrary to all established fact because you resent someone's car is scary and sickening.  Talk about entirely screwed up priorities.

I see success with women who have been using since before they hit puberty. A lot of that has to do with the fact that these women are pregnant, homeless, or are court mandated to be there so they really have no other option. However, I've seen failures as well. There have been times where the Department of Child Services have come to take away children from these women because of failed drug tests or probation violations. Sobriety depends on the person and their desire to change. Only you can want to stay clean and sober. You are the problem, but you're also the solution.

&gt; Take the weed/welfare conversation a few years back. Congress was thinking of imposing a drug test for all welfare recipients. Naturally, you'd think people would want to make sure the tax dollars they give to the government were going to people that were putting it to good use right?
&gt; 

They tried that in FL. It cost more money than it saved. Oh but like a regular conservative the Governor's friend who owned the drug testing place came out ahead.

My favorite part of Florida welfare drug testing:

&gt; Rick Scott pushed mandatory drug testing—provided, in part, by his wife’s company, Solantic⁠. Scott transferred his $62 million stake⁠ in the company to his wife only a few months before mandating drug testing for state employees and welfare recipients.

Can't say I've done urban exploring but me (22 f) and a friend walked around for a while, had a nice conversation with a guy who was trying to find pot (sadly, we could not help him) and another guy who was just wandering around bored. Honestly most of the homeless are pretty okay if you're nice to them. White, black, whatever. Nobody gives a shit. Act like you belong and not like a nervous weirdo and you'll be fine. 

As far as legalities go, multiple friends of mine got caught sneaking into an abandoned mall and ended up 3/4 getting probation and mandatory drug tests so would say all in all not worth it. Most of them will claim you were trying to steal copper and shit.

That people on welfare should be drug tested.

First of all, it ends up costing more money than it saves. Drug tests aren't cheap. If the end goal is to save money for the government, this isn't the way to go.

Second of all, it's infringing on people's privacy. When you get a job, the company can drug test you because you are representing the company and they want to make sure you are able to do the job. You are providing a service for them, so it makes since that they don't want you to be on drugs. Welfare recipients are simply receiving money to survive. They aren't providing a service. The only thing that matters is they don't have the income to survive on their own. Some might say, well if they can do drugs they can buy food. Which is true SOMETIMES. But some people share. I smoke weed regularly, but I never spend money on it. Most of my friends smoke, my boyfriend smokes, my neighbor smokes. I do it with them. If I lost my job today and I applied for food stamps tomorrow and if they drug tested I'd be denied food because I smoked with other people.

But yeah it's just a bunch of poverty shamming high and mighty bullshit.

So, Happened twice, once was my own fault, the other, well, you could say it was also my fault.

First time, about 9 years ago, I was joining the USMC. I was in highschool still, so I was in the Delayed Entry Program. My parents had already signed the necesary paperwork and whatnot, I was only 17. I liked to smoke weed, as did my brother and all of our friends. It was hard for me to quit, it actually took me the last couple months of the school year and all summer. My recruiter was amazing, he actually stuck with me the whole time, trying to motivate me and taking me to poolee events. I even needed a waiver once I finally got to MEPS. 
One of the tricks I did to get "clean" was drinking vinegar. My recruiter actually told me about this. I quit smoking weed for about 3 weeks, drinking a glass of vinegar and oj like 4 times a week. I passed his test he gave me at the office, we were both really happy and I was proud of myself. Went to MEPS, passed. 
I was finally going to MCRD San Diego! I was so damned excited, the people who were going with me, even though we had come from half the US, and only known each other for a couple days, were already like brothers. I had never gotten to know people so fast and so well before. 

Get to bootcamp, it is a dream come true, I am in fucking disnesyland. There was a DI with an eye patch, he walked up to the kid who was first in line off the bus, lifts up his eye patch to show this black, gnarled hole, and says "one day, boy, you can earn one of these!"

So, about 4 weeks later, we were outside the classroom, and our Killhat comes running up and requests me and two others. I was a scribe at the time, so I thought nothing of it, really, it was normal. 
Took me to my Senior, and he told me that they found some tiny amount of THC in my system and that I had to call whoever it was I was going to be going back to(which was no one, I ended up being homeless) so I called my mom, told her while trying(and failing) not to cry. Then later on in the day when the rest of the platoon got back to the squadbay, my Senior asked me if I wanted to tell them all what happened, and I did. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. 

Second time, was only a couple months ago. Basically, there is a girl I have had a crush on since the first day of 6th grade. She knows I am madly in love with her, we are friends, have been since about 6th grade and have had relations in the past. She needed help, so I let her come stay with me. One night, after what I thought was amazing sex, she asked me if I wanted to have a baby. Now, I have wanted to raise a family with this woman for years. It is literally a dream of mine. I eagerly said yes, and we cuddled and slept. A week or two later, the sex stops, she is acting strange and going out alot. It is pretty obvious she is seeing someone else. I ask her about it, and tell her she can be honest with me. She tells me nothing is going on. Couple more weeks, no sex, I ask again. She tells me nothing, and gets defensive. Finally, after some liquid courage, I confront her about it and make her admit it to me. She apologized profusely, said shes sorry for ruining our friendship. Now I'm sitting here, heartbroken and dreams smashed. 

TLDR;
Kicked out of USMC bootcamp for popping on my drug test(actually a surprise)

Girl of my dreams basically scammed me for a place to stay by tugging on my hearstrings. 

Oh yeah, forgot to answer the question:
I'm not coping very well, but, with alcohol, marijuana, and crying. I dont really like to talk to people in RL about it. The girl, people know about the Marine thing.

Research has shown the number of drug users is almost non-existent, and that requiring drug testing for welfare recipients has cost more money than it's worth. I believe you're entitled to your opinion just like everyone else, but I think the reason people disagree with you is because all research shows what a waste of time and money this policy has been in addition to discriminating against people simply because they're poor. Why shouldn't politicians be drug tested? Or anyone who benefits from taxes for that matter? And none of this is meant as a challenge to you, but I just want to know what you think in light the real world results.

I do have a very large contempt for voters. Get out and vote campaigns have given us nothing but an ignorant voting base who votes for reasons like, and I'm quoting from the Primary here, "I voted for Rick Perry, because he wears cowboy boots and so does my husband!"

Fuck that. If getting a photo-ID is too hard for someone, they obviously don't care enough to vote.

In response for the drug testing on welfare recipients, no I do not support drug tests on anyone. I think it's an invasion of privacy. I actually support increased funding towards these programs so that they've got enough staff to root out fraudulent welfare recipients, which would in the end save money.

And to the original topic, no, 2 votes is not an epidemic. But just 2 votes that could be proven was enough to cause the election to be tossed out. The epidemic is what isn't caught, because voter fraud is nearly undetectable. That's why there is no hard data to prove widespread voter-fraud. Some interesting reads:

Those are, in fact, not the studies I was talking about. In any event, you have some logical problems with that particular assertion: 1600 welfare recipients refused to pay for drug tests. That's all you actually know. There's several possible reasons for this:

* It's insulting as hell and they didn't want to do it.
* They couldn't afford to pay for the testing.
* They were on drugs or had been and knew they would fail.

Basically - Who knows? Other studies show that drug use among welfare recipients is around the same level as the general population but (and this is key): Most of that drug use is so infrequent and low that it a tiny, tiny percentage would actually show up on drug screens. 

So hey! It's more complicated than anyone might think.

ALSO: (**Fuck my life... this started out as two quick paragraphs to inform OP about this supplement, and whaddya know... went way fucking offtopic. Don't worry, I'll show where to stop reading to only get the useful info and skip the bullshit lol**) Ever hear of a supplement called 'Vitadone?' I heard some clinics sell it (mine doesn't), as well as some drug stores, but if all else fails, I'm sure it'd be easy to find online. Basically it's a supplement for MMT patients, to help curb some of the side effects, like too much sweating, craving sugar too much, even constipation, and possibly even weight gain/increased appetite. Not 100% on all that it does, but I've heard tons of people, even on here, absolutely swearing by it, and it's helped them so well that it seems that it's worth a shot for anybody who's negatively affected by those side effects on MMT, and wants relief from them. If it doesn't work, then at least you tried, you know? 

I never tried it because I don't have enough negative side effects to justify it. Hell it's so weird, I don't crave sugar any more than before, I don't sweat more than before, constipation's the same with any opiate, and I manage that okay, and it seems like my appetite has actually DECREASED instead of increased lol. Idk if I gained any weight though, or if it like slowed down my metabolism at all, meaning that I'd be more likely to gain weight from not eating as much (my whole life basically, my metabolism has been incredibly fast, that I could stuff my face, and always stay at the same weight. I'd rarely gain weight. I'm 20 years old rn, and only 130-140 pounds (haven't weighed myself recently, I should do that though, I'm curious lol). And like 5 foot 9, or 10 inches. So def underweight, but hey beats bein overweight I guess? right? g-guys? 

So yea anyway moral of this post is google search '**Vitadone**' and do some research. See if it sounds like it could help you out. Ask your clinic if they sell it, or know who does locally. Check local stores, or just websites that'll ship it to you, which might be easier in your situation for all I know, which I don't lol. Anyway best of luck though! I'm so glad to hear how Methadone's working great for you! 

**==I START GOING ON AND ON ABOUT ADDICTION, RECOVERY METHODS, MENTAL ILLNESS, ETC... Mainly about the lack of self control issue I've had with dope, but now it's just the lack of control to not type huge freakin Novel's in the comments, whether they're completely 100% on topic, or only 5% on topic and 95% off topic** 

Shit def is a miracle drug for me, since legit no other maintanence drug worked, no rehabs, detoxes, IOPs, residential programs, oupatient programs, psych wards/meds, being homeless and hoping I'd get sick of the junkie life... nothing worked, until this. Just kickin myself for not tryin it sooner, but idk I feel that if I tried it without trying some other methods, I'd always feel pissed, and like 'what if'... 'what if those other methods worked for me, like rehabs, or an inpatient residential program or some shit, or even the shitty ass 12 steps (hahahahaha)? I'd be addicted to 'done and not even know if I truly 'needed' to be on it. 

But in only a year, I tried all of those things, multiple times even, to no avail. So now that I've tried everything worth trying, and based on my personal mindset, addiction level, opinions, the way my brain personally works, etc... I'm more than happy I've found a home with methadone, and my parents are overjoyed to have their 'old son' back. It's like to them, me being their son 'before I started on drugs', indicating to me how much I changed on it, and now I'm like the 'old' version of me lol. I'm glad they're so happy, and I'm glad this shit's working amazingly for me, as well as anyone who's on it. However I obviously don't care *which* method somebody uses, as long as it actually works for them of course, and stays working, if you know what I mean lol. 

Dammit, I knew I'd end up making some kinda lame little 'speech' about this eventually when the topic of methadone success came up. And it happened like the way I foretold too lol... I'd congratulate somebody on it, and also mention how well its been working for me, while justifying why I'm on it, and how it's my last option, and luckily it worked, or I'd haven been fuuuuuuuuuuuucked. 

But once again, In my opinion, regardless of method one uses... you still have to be ready to stop. this just makes it easier, but still you need the mindset of being ready to not use again. Because obviously I know there's people at my clinic who walk about doing dope, coke, crack, pills, etc, and I'm not them obviously, so I don't know their motivations... Maybe the courts forced them into MMT or some shit, or their family, and they figured they'd do this to shut them both up, or w/e, while still using when they can/want to. Idk I'm not them, and can only just hope they stay safe, and don't die because their mental illness of addiction is preventing them from being at the stage in their addiction of truly wanting to quit, or stay clean. But shit, even then it's way more complicated than that it seems. People who supposedly want nothing more than to never go near dope again end up ODing the day they leave rehab, or their sober home, after like a year of sobriety even (but usually way less). 

*sigh* it makes me so sad. Addiction, as well as the plethora of other mental health disorders, are sooooo misunderstood, and due to all the stigma surrounding both, and those suffering with both, it's easy for people to not get proper treatment, and have tons of variables making that shit harder, or even if in treatment, it not working, and shit like that, because their brain is rewired to never be happy without opiates, and they'll either end up suiciding(?) or relapsing. At least with Subs or 'done, the patient is on an opiate daily, which allows a lot of those issues to be null now, but for me, subs didn't do SHIT for cravings. Sucks because subs are waaaaaay more convenient than 'done.. Going to see them monthly, pick up the script, see them for the 'counselling appointment' for 5 mins. And occasionally taking random (or even planned) drug tests... way easier. But w/e, not everything works for everyone, and luckily I'm a NEET loser with no life so Idc that I gotta go to the clinic daily, and weekly counselling for a few mins, and soon, a weekly group for like 30-45 mins. It's all good. 

Fuck I keep sayin this but my TRUE addiction is just writing way too much fucking shit on reddit comments/forums lmfao. Even facebook. Fuck I know it's the methadone's fault. Heroin would make me talk people's ears off. And now on methadone, its the same shit. IRL or online (or both). After dosing I always notice I got pinned pupils too. I don't feel high, but I always feel 'good', that opoid 'satiation', of feeling good, right... peaceful, generally. And mainly, not thinking about other opiates, or wanting to go out and do them, with only the very rare, occasional 'dope dream', or random craving, which goes away quickly and never affects me enough to consider using at all luckily! So glad this shit worked for me. finally. I now have a chance to live, and not risk dying daily, just so I don't feel miserable, and prob commit suicide due to that. Hell, this 'done even took away my depression! Just gotta deal with this anxiety disorder(s) (GAD and SAD) that new places seem to wanna screen me out for, imaganing that I'm just a drug seeker from the start, after only answering their question(s) honestly, and saying my diagnosis, 2 fucking words. But noooooo, they're so misused and overused today, and in the medical field, it's like they assume every and any young person with the diagnosis of GAD or SAD just wants fucking benzos. 

Yea benzos would be good if they'd work well, but any pill that works is fine, regardless of class, but NO SSRIs! Fuck those damn suicidal thought/dream inducing shitty ass pills. Yeah great thing to give someon whos depressed/anxious... a pill that'll now make them have the mindset to killthemselves, which they didn't have before, or wasn't strong at all like it is now due to those pills. Totally fucked up. 

**I wanna wire my keyboard to give me an electrical shock if I go over a certain character limit, no bullshit. My no self control issue has switched from not being able to ever save dope, or wake up shots, but now I can't stop typing on and on and on. I could probably easily type like 500,000 characters in a single reddit/forum/facebook comment/post. **

It's because most of the nation will not have the  time or  resources to follow most of these lesser-known issues you are mentioning.

What they DO know about him nationwide is that he passed Act 10 in a pretty blue state, took on unions, and won a recall election and second term for 3 wins in 4 years. That's the short story that most have, like it or not.

They aren't going to see the relatively minor cuts to education, Corporate tax breaks are one-off and don't make national media. They certainly aren't going to hear about things like voter ID and right to work, because it's just been talks. Nothing has happened with either. At least that the general national public will see.

And while you don't think right to work will work, or that drug testing welfare recipients will work- those are issues that are still fairly evenly split nationwide. Much of the country won't be turned off by that, especially republicans.

For the record, my property taxes dropped by almost $700 this year. Not that it makes a difference.

&gt; I'm saying using entirely unrelated statistics to make an ideological point is worse than gutter journalism.

How are the statistics that he presented "entirely unrelated"? The whole point of the article was to discredit the absurd claim that only 0.12% of welfare users take drugs, and his statistics do just that. Also, what sort of ideology do you feel the author is promulgating? Are you sure you didn't just read something you disagree with (for reasons that I still don't understand) and immediately assume that the author has a nefarious ideological agenda? That's acting in bad faith.

&gt;[The author] ignored reality in favour of making a post because he doesn't like the truth.

You still have yet to demonstrate (or even attempt to demonstrate) that anything the author said is incorrect. I suspect *you* might be the one experiencing cognitive dissonance here, not the author.

&gt; And even if people are spending. Their welfare dollars on drugs I still don't think that's a reason to force them to piss in jars considering that people with far more responsibility are held to a lesser standard.

This passage makes me suspect that you either haven't read the article, or, as a previous poster suggested, you have serious trouble with reading comprehension. I'll say it again: the author does **not** want to force people on welfare to be drug tested! Hell, *it's even in the title of the article*. His point is that you can make the argument against testing without having to resort to bad statistics and outright lies regarding the frequency of drug use among the poor.

&gt; It's a further move to dehumanise and demonise the poor by the right

The fact that anyone could read this article and come away with that impression is, frankly, shocking. It's clear to me that you have a serious tendency to ascribe the worst possible motives and intentions to people who say things that, at first glance, don't jive with or support your political objectives and positions. This is what I mean when I say you are acting in bad faith.

Can you point me to something the author said that "demonizes and dehumanizes the poor"? Actual quotes from the article would be preferable. Why do you assume that he is a right wing shill? Are you in the habit of characterizing everyone who says something you disagree with as "right wing" (as if that constitutes an argument)?

&gt;it's fucking disgusting.

Your faux-outrage and posturing doesn't make you look noble or give you the moral high-ground. It only serves to underscore how poorly you've understood this piece and how eager you are to project the characteristics and intentions you hate most on anyone who says something that challenges your prior assumptions.

Also, I'm still waiting for you to answer the simple questions I asked you before: Do you think only 0.12% of poor people use drugs? Would you still oppose drug tests of welfare recipients if this was untrue?

You really worried about money? The money we will spend on drug tests is 1/83523984563894653984658934659834659834650289364509823645th the money the government wastes on stupid crap far far worse than this. We might actually save money in the long run.

Let me ask a question. Why should people who spend their income on drugs be subsidized by the government to buy the necessities in life? Im not saying everyone on welfare is on drugs. But they won't have to worry will they?

You could say the kids will go hungry. But really we suck as a society if the most we are willing to do is make sure the children of drug addicted parents are fed. Thats nice, but the damage is being done regardless.

This is a good resource, thanks. I noticed that the states aren't actually testing all their tanf applicants. Only those who are reasonably suspect of drug use are tested. I wonder how they choose these people.

Where did you get the 12k number? I'm getting 3k a year using 2013 numbers.

What you found are greatnumbers, but what if every tanf applicant was searched? As thinkprogress didn't include the costs of finding the necessary evidence for further review.

If the head of household, one person, were tested from every tanf accepting family, using 2013 numbers, it would cost 2.7% of TANFs 2013 budget.

http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/resource/caseload-data-2014

This (admittedly old at 2002) ways and means reports a fraud rate at around 2%
http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy/humres/107cong/6-11-02/6-11find.htm

I don't know how fraud has changed over the years, but I do know that TANF has decreased.

I assume the costs of investigating people in Arizone, Utah, Ok, Kansas, etc. are kind of high, but with no regard to them, there does seem to be a point in doing them.

But if you were to test everyone as some politicians in my state, and I assume other states have proposed, it would be a massive cost, around .7% of 10 billion.

I do wonder if other states will follow suite with florida and make drug testing welfare recipients illegal though.

I think everyone would agree that they do not want their tax money given to anyone to use for drugs or anything illegal. With this logic, though, students receiving government money for college should be drug tested. Anyone receiving any type of tax credit should be drug tested. Every person receiving any type of government money should be tested. Also studies show welfare recipients do not use drugs at higher rates than the rest of the population. In Florida the rate was only 2.6% compared to 8% of the total population.
<TRUE>

Random testing may improve the "catch rate" but is it worth it? Why are we only testing people who recieve food stamps. Why not drug test everyone who receives government funds (mayors, governors, their entire staff). It seems like this feeds into the narrative that poor people are poor because they are lazy and all do drugs. 

Most people using these programs *need* the money and just trying to get by. Florida found 2% of people receiving food stamps tested positive for drugs. I bet if you did the same test on government officials, you could find more than 2%. 

TL;DR: Its a waste of time and money worrying about people on food stamps.

He was even a co-author of   'Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality'.

I refused to be a part of porn because of the treatment of women that do the job. Some porn companies try to make it difficult for the women intentionally. If you ever heard of a young exiting woman that made a gonzo movie called donkey punch, her story is like many women in porn. 

 Some women wondered why is she taking this abuse from this man and continuing to shoot with him and say 'sexy' 'nice' things to him with a cracked worried voice on the verge of crying while he is spitting in her face and other things? This is because she already had shot scenes with rough sex several times with the man, and she knows if she trys to leave the 'shoot', before he is satisfied, - she wont get a dime for all the work she did already. 
[but if she can take this for the day, she can get 3,000 cash, and hopefully wont have to go to the hospital for tears and abscesses. ]

 She was so broke at the time, and no choice, already signed a contract and 'sold' her right to consent to say no when it became violent unwanted abusive sex [rape]. Rent was due. If you stop the abuse, you lose everything. You are already hurt and you become homeless as well. To the men's delight, they enjoy doing that as a regular practice to young women in that position in the porn industry. The women deal with it by going on drugs.

If drug testing[because of consent issues with drugs &amp; rape are common] was part of the disease screening for legal porn, most all porn actresses would not qualify for work. 

 The worst Men in the sex industry already understand that male demand is buying this more than the actual sex; they want all women in adult industries in that position, they are not allowed to withdraw consent in porn[ or they don't get paid at all, even if they worked most of the day and are bleeding]. Some get too injured to go on for the day and leave for the day to come back the next day to get paid, and find out the guys packed up with out paying them, they gave up getting paid by 'walking away' and their movie is already on a pay site 24 hrs later. The porn company does not even pay for the woman to go to the hospital if the company hurt her while filming.

 Their 'suitcase pimp,' if they have one- will usually tell them to get paid before they leave for the day[he wants the all the money, she made- and a pimp gets his money.] Porn makers don't tell noobs this. These are street women, and young women with no legal means, knowledge or recourse to go after pornmakers. Guys fully take that advantage of any women entering that abusive industry and they shut down discussions about these abuses. 

This is the only 'job' that will treat it's biggest money making employees like things men later discard, offer then no healthcare or protections from predatory men like other jobs. In the porn industry, Women are not as valued as the porn they make.

And pleeeenty of people working get drug tested on a regular basis to keep their positions. It's also very common for people *not* to be partaking in drug use. My husband is one, my sister is another who get tested regularly.


What i mean is that they become addicted to whatever they use and are not active members of society. It's these same people who take advantage of welfare. You say many programs require people to have jobs. Well i think they all should.


My problem with drug use is that it's illegal. No matter how you look at it. Why should my sister be declined a job for trying pot *once* while people on welfare using get free money?


When pot/shrooms become legal I'll be fine with it. When outstanding citizens get careers for telling the truth about recreational use, I'll stop having a problem with it. Until then...


I'm for legalizing pot just so this kind of double standard nonsense will stop.

Do you think the impetus was throwing money to drug testing companies, or demonizing the poor?  I think drug-testing companies were willing to take their money, but only a handful of them owned stakes in those companies.  I think the selling point for all the other Republican politicians is the message that "Of course we have to drug test welfare recipients: they're all criminals and moochers!"

Florida is like the sandbox of America. All the batshit insane garbage laws get passed here to test the waters. Floridian Legislators don't give a shit about these families that are forced to sell their homes without giving the opportunity to find an alternative residence, because they aren't getting paid by the home owners. Hell, we wasted tens of thousands of dollars on drug testing welfare recipients of welfare, and yet that retarded policy is poised to spread to other states.

Free speech is the freedom to speak without the government interfering, not freedom from consequences for saying offensive things. I have the freedom to say whatever I want at my job, but if I was openly racist (as this officer was) I would be fired. Also, one often has to give up certain rights as a condition of employment--I'm sure that he at some point in his career consented to a drug test, so this officer willingly gave up some of his right to privacy. I feel (and clearly this cop's supervisors do, too*) that being a law enforcement officer should mean that one gives up the right to openly and publicly be a bigot. I personally feel that openly racist individuals should be barred from public sector jobs, just as a matter of principle. As a practical matter, nearly 27% of Roanoke's is black--A guy who assumes that all black people are on welfare simply cannot effectively protect and serve his city. No African-American citizen can trust this individual. Effective community policing requires mutual respect between cops and the public. This guy is obviously unworthy of respect and quite clearly does not respect those he serves.
*We'll see how strenuously the supervisors fight against the inevitable police union demands that this guy gets his back pay once his suspension ends.

the problem is how you figure out who is "lazy" and who is not, and whether it costs more to try to figure it out than what you save--and also, what then happens to those "lazy" people.

It's like drug testing welfare recipients. It's cruel, pointless, and costs you more than you save, all so people can feel a brutal sense of cosmic justice. Because it's easy to get pissed at the person in front of you at the supermarket paying with an EBT card, but you don't see the corporate tax cheat with the same regularity.

Both my sense of justice and my desire for good governance would be better served by hiring more IRS agents to sniff out tax corporate tax cheats.

"fucks like me" who work my ass off to afford things that I want to earn and use.

"fucks like me" who pay the overbearing taxes to the government of this country to support this fucked up and mis-lead country.

"fucks like me" who don't live beyond my means because I know that i can only afford the things that I have enough money for.

"fucks like me" who prefer to not extend (even more) handouts to people that do nothing but make them ever so reliant on the government teet.

"fucks like me" who work towards something to make myself and my family the best life that I can.

No, FuckFaceNate it is indeed the "fucks like you" who think that I should give up even more than the 40% that I already do in order to just willy-nilly pass free shit out to people because "its the right thing to do"

I am all for social assistance programs that help people actually grow themselves. But if you don't see a problem with someone sitting on their porch and getting a check in the mail once a month; with no intention of ever getting up off that porch....then no amount of logic can help you.

These homeless people want to live that vacant house down the street that the government owns? OK...take this drug test and meet your new boss Uncle Sam. Put them to work cleaning the streets, paving the highways, building the parks; you know.... WORKING to earn that free shit that I pay for.

**Right-wing trust fund kids on welfare programs for the poor:**

Fuck 'em, let them starve.  It's not my problem.  Taxation is literally rape, etc etc

*&lt;Insert public outcry here&gt;*

OK fine, we support welfare for the poor.  They just need to present their driver's license, complete an obstacle course, get drug tested, submit a stool sample, fly to the welfare office on Alpha Centauri to file paperwork, get drug tested again, and submit their grocery list for public review.  It's the taxpayer's money, so the government has the right to attach as many strings as they see fit.

We have the constitutional right to use the taxpayer's money to publish anything we want with no questions asked, and nobody can say otherwise BECAUSE FREEZE PEACH!!!!!11

Aside from the obvious expense of the program, is there really a problem with the principle of drug testing welfare recipients? If you want the benefits of a society is it too much to ask them to follow the rules of that society?

Look on facebook on poorer areas around the first of the month. It's a ton of people selling ebt and snap benefits for under their value in cash. Hmm I wonder where that's going..

First of all, let's talk about "meeting the goals at the lowest possible cost".  [Studies have shown](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/25/240590433/what-happens-when-you-just-give-money-to-poor-people) that giving money to poor people is one of the most effective ways of improving their lives.  When you look at drug testing of welfare recipients, or restrictions like those in MO, you are spending more money on monitoring the programs.  Then, when you catch people using their funds in unapproved ways, you have police, court and jail costs.  All this to keep someone from carefully budgeting their money so they can give their kid a couple of shrimp on their birthday.

Moreover, this seems to be part of the sentiment that we need to humiliate the poor, to make sure they are constantly aware that they are a drain on society, and don't deserve anything good in their lives.

But every time they go into a store and use their EBT card, every time they sign their kids up for free lunches at school, when they tell them they can't get new clothes, or see a movie or get a gaming console or a computer for school, they are reminded clearly of what they don't have.  There's no need to rub their noses in it.  

This should be a safety net - because things could turn to shit for any of us.  What good does the added humiliation do?

Finally, the bill isn't intended to do good, it's political posturing.  It's designed to appeal to our baser instincts.  It doesn't say, "we are all in this together as a society - we'll help our brothers and sisters when they are down, and they'd do the same for us".  Instead it says, "Fine, I'll give you your goddamn crust of bread, but you're going to have to crawl for it".  Is that the kind of society you want?

It's actually kind of interesting to think about that. This might be why Republicans have such a visceral reaction to things like welfare. 

The first reaction out of a Republican is something like "Some people abuse welfare, they're STEALING from me!! They're lazy!!". They want to cancel the program because it feels like a personal attack on their own resources or like those people aren't helping out the group and just taking from it. They make an error by generalizing without enough evidence because it feels bad.

Whereas to someone like me the first thing I think is "You can't generalize based on a few examples. How many people use welfare as intended, and is it worth devoting the resources to find the freeloaders? It could be that this investment costs more than you save by finding and excluding them."

Sure enough, when they implemented those drug testing programs to catch some of the welfare freeloaders it ends up costing more than it saves because lo and behold, the vast majority of people on welfare aren't drug users. I wouldn't have predicted that as anything more than a possibility, but I think we should check our assumptions first before implementing programs like that.

You rally against "free" stuff. But somehow keep missing the obvious.

In other countries with "free" healthcare, they spend less than we do here. 

In America, we spend more on healthcare (purely from taxes) than all but 3 other countries.

THEN we all have to buy insurance

THEN we have to actually pay to see doctors and get things done.

So you prefer having more of your money taken both by taxes and by private corporations, instead of less of your money and less of everyone else's money?

How exactly do you win?

Is it safe to assume you also want drug testing for welfare recipients even though that also costs more of your money?
<TRUE>

I like the way Utah does the tests because it doesn't completely stigmatize welfare recipients just for the fact that their poor and it provides those that are found to use with treatment. I feel like you shouldn't just cut off people from benefits because they use drugs otherwise you're just making them even more poor and they'll turn to more drugs and even crime. 

I agree that the alcohol and tobacco testing should be implemented as well, but only if treatment is offered for those that use it. Addiction is a medical condition, not a lack of willpower or morals.

Do you think you could find a source for "Drug testing saves money in the long run"? I can't seem to find any that collaborate with that statement. 

Edit: I also don't think these drug testing programs should only be applied to welfare recipients. Rather than testing them, I think the government should put more money into treating addiction and help making it less stigmatized instead. This would have far greater societal benefits in my opinion.

&gt;Im not basing my opinion on this matter from Internet articles. Im basing this off of real life experiences. I grew up very poor, I lived in "the ghetto". I then got a job (paramedic) that put me in these areas on a daily basis for years. There is actual evidence of this happening, it is simply going there and seeing it on a daily basis.

You're one person in one place. The research that has been performed is of thousands of people in many different places. Their aggregate story and the data across the country are at odds with your lived experience. You're an outlier. It would be like saying that because you got a 20 on a test that it was a bad test when everyone else got 80s.
Or, it could be that as a paramedic, you get to see people when they are bad.

The argument isn't if someone should/shouldn't lose their job over a drug test. The argument is that people who support drug testing for welfare participants also complain that we're spending too much taxpayer money on these programs. So instead of spending that money in a way that would actually help these people, these people advocate that we waste millions of dollars drug testing a population that has a significantly lower rate of drug use than the average person.

As for the one article you read, it was a newspaper article. Did you read the research articles that the newspaper was discussing? Because those articles are based on empirical research (which, by the way, isn't confined to "statistical analysis").

&gt;So, my question now: If drug testing did not work, why do employers still mandate that drug testing be performed? 

Oh, that's a shitty argument! Your employer does a lot of things that don't work well! We're talking about wasting millions and millions of dollars on something we've proven is not worth it.

&gt; that they could actually get a job and not worry with the drug testing aspect of the application process,

Most women on welfare are not doing drugs. Even if they were, the types of jobs that the welfare office funnels them into are low-skilled, low-paying jobs that do not drug test. 

&gt;I do hate seeing people that have essentially given up, and feel like the only hope of having a good time is through the use of a crack rock or meth pipe, because that is what is happening right now. At least in my city, but after talking with multiple people from different areas of the country, its essentially the same everywhere.

I'm sure you do see these people every day. The issue is that you're equating the poor with welfare participants. You don't know if they're on TANF, or getting SNAP benefits, or getting a housing subsidy (in fact, many people who are eligible for these types of benefits do not apply for them because  of the heavy stigma). You're in a job that puts you in contact with a lot of people in shitty situations. But that doesn't change the facts, and the facts are that drug testing welfare participants is a huge waste of money.

&gt; Unless you're truly suggesting that 99 out of every 100 people are abusing drugs, then I can't take the rest of this conversation seriously.

This is a double standard then. The policy being argued about is a drug test, not a drug-abuse test.

At some level , you have to either stand against drugs being used (of any kind for non-essential purposes) or accept that the number of raging addicts on welfare is actually hilariously small and a policy like this does little more than waste everyone's time.

This is especially true considering the short amount of time that most drugs spend detectable in the body, making it more and more likely that any "offenders" you catch with this program are cannabis users.

However, at the end of the day, it's also a question of what society gets out of this. There's no research to suggest that giving impoverished people *less* makes them get out any faster. There's no evidence suggesting that addicts who don't have money get cleaned up more easily. By all means though, if you want to encourage more petty theft while depriving casual marijuana users access to welfare, this is the way to do it.

Heroin/meth addict in recovery, here. I'm so sorry that you are going through this. I can't imagine how horrible it is to be the parent on the other side of the situation, and I still feel awful for putting my own parents through it. 

     The best piece of advice I can give you is to cut him off financially. Don't give him a cent. For food, for rent somewhere, for anything. Tell him that you love him and when he's ready to get clean for good your door is open and you'll help him (on the condition that he consents to random drug tests and follows rules you set, such as no contact with former friends, treatment, therapy, etc.), but you will not support him in any form or fashion while he is using.

     I know it sounds harsh and maybe even impossible, but it's the only reason I ended up realizing how horrible being a drug addict is and getting clean. Yes, I was hungry, homeless, and eventually in jail, but I am ALIVE.

     Addiction is not something you can throw money at, beat out of someone, or anything else. The only thing you can do is not make it easy on him to be an addict. If his life goes to shit and he's homeless, has no food, and has no one to bail him out of jail when he gets arrested, he will be much more likely to realize that he doesn't want to live that life.  If he's using and still has a place to live, food anytime he needs it, a car, etc. why would he give it up?

     I'm not saying it's a guaranteed fix because there is no guaranteed fix, but it helps the odds. You have to be tough and stick to your guns if you want a chance of him beating this. You have to be tough for his sake, even though he might not realize that you're doing it in his best interest right now. You can do it, and so can he.  *hugs*

When I was researching Florida welfare policy for a paper, I found that the percent of welfare recipients caught on drugs by Florida's drug test program was around 1.2%.

That's not much.

I do remember that before they cancelled it, it was an expense hundreds of times greater than the money lost to these drug use victims.


Not to mention the fact that the expensive drug testing contracts went to companies a little close to the governor.

edit: If anyone cares, I can dig around for the paper and see if I can get the cites, it is a really interesting read.

Is it? I hadn't thought about that.  Hmm, I still think there should be random drug testing for them, just like how in Florida they drug test welfare recipients...
