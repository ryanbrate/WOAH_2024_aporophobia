Ok.... everyone has their opinion on what the church needs. 

But the the thing is, people do not know what they want. see Malcom gladwell's Ted talk on spaghetti sauce. If you ask people what they want, they will almost never tell you the a curate thing they want (because we suck at knowing ourselves). I think the biggest problem the church has is asking what the members want and then giving them exactly that. In the 90s, Gen x asked for the rock concerts. The church gave it to them. Melinials asked for free coffee, to wear jeans. They gave it to us. Now "we" are asking for liturgy. I think giving it to us would only be continuing a long path of confusion.

What do Melinials actually want? Well, it is up to the church to anticipate needs. 

This is my opinion: operate like a university. Reduce the music time. Reduce the sermon time. Take out any chanting. Take out any jargon that isn't immediately followed by an explaination.  Make half of it q and a. If the pastor says something wrong, make it ok for the congregation to raise their hands and say so, during the sermon. Invite college professors in to moderate, different ones every time. Have guest speakers from different churches to challenge thought. Have guest speakers from different religions. Have members of the congregation tell stories of their hardest times and how they got through it. Have licensed therapists on staff. Have a legit clinic. Have ways of coping with mental illness. Invest in smart giving to the community... not fly by night missionaries or hustler "homeless" that rip off every church. 

Have young professional networking meetups. Promote everything local, don't focus on Africa or other things the church does not understand. 

Lean into the real hardships of life, don't sugarcoat it with stained glass but also provide positivity. Don't feel super happy cultish.

I'm conflicted. I grew up in Mexico, where we were told not to give money to beggars and the homeless because it would keep them on the streets or in the payroll of criminals employing child labor. I now live in the US and seeing how little government support there is for the homeless and mentally ill makes me feel so terrible ignoring them. These people live a daily hell and I'm not sure if giving them $5 really makes any difference for them or if it makes things worse...

For what it's worth I highly doubt she was schizophrenic. I had to live with her for three months or so, in that time many mentally ill people came and went from the homeless shelter. She was one of the stable ones.

Just because someone is mentally ill doesn't mean they are violent or dangerous.  Also, if you have young kids you would understand that they don't tend to have the same inhibitions and social prejudices that the rest of us develop over a lifetime and don't hesitate to ask awkward questions in situations where the rest of us would likely shy away.  I don't see any harm in it, they are just satisfying their curiousity.  

Homeless people are no more dangerous than anyone else you might meet on the street, and there's a (largely unfounded) stigma attached to mental illness that we need to actively work to eliminate.

Well I wish those that interact with you the best of luck and hopefully you keep your superior intelligence at bay. I can understand now why humor is lost on you and your need to feel superior. Stay in your field as any established or stable people would cringe at your communication skills and would make you feel inferior. I truly feel bad for those who you help.

Institutions can be shitty, but only when they are allowed to become so through neglect. The backlash against them started in the 1960s and 1970s based on some very real and appalling stories from specific institutions, but then a cost-cutting movement seized on this as an opportunity to shut 'em all down. But compulsory treatment and institutionalization are the only real option for the severely mentally ill and chronically homeless. Their illness will often have led them to fear and reject voluntary treatment or government support, and until it is treated they will remain homeless. 

Ideally, sure, their family and community would take care of them, and no that would not be a 'drain on the economy.' It'd be cheaper than institutions! Hell, ideally they would not be mentally ill in the first place. In the real world though, they are likely homeless because they have no family or have destroyed their ties with them in some fashion. In the real world, are you going to let your schizophrenic uncle stay with you after he's refused meds and perhaps threatened violence against you? Do you routinely invite street people in your community to come and stay with you?

Yep, I've been psychotic a few times and never sectioned. Usually I get so paranoid I don't step out, or I'm so overwhelmingly interested in something that the interest stops me for doing other reckless things, if that makes sense.... Painting/drawing on paper that spreads to the walls, etc. I've been cutting grass and seeing only dead soldiers and blood where the grass blades were, weeping uncontrollably for the poor grass. Receiving messages from space, believing the government was watching me from the TV, etc., etc. Never sectioned, even after a suicide attempt. Where I live it's particularly hard to stand out as strange though. Rather like being mentally ill in Glasgow I expect, you have to go that extra mile.
(no offence to Glaswegians)

There have been a couple of moments my wife has locked me in a room while she hides knives, ropes, belts, etc., but they were more mixed states.

I too believed I was the next Buddha, went around stripping off and handing my clothes and shoes to homeless people. Weird. That all stopped in my late twenties, and I sort of feel guilty for losing it - like I lost my spirituality, something I thought made me very special, and now I'm soul-less to some extent.

Despite many psychotic and delusional periods, and associated hallucinations at times, I'm counted as bp2 "because I've never been hospitalised". Treatment has relied on lithium, Depakote and Quetiapine. I'm up way more than down.
I don't mind though, there's probably less stigma with bp2, and the treatment involves the same set of drugs. I'm just glad I'm never getting SSRI's again.

They should move all the homeless services to one area of town so the homeless can have ease of access to services and to keep track of the individuals in the community. Never forget the homeless are people too who have their own stories. Most individuals who are homeless and living on the street have mental illnesses. So the real question is how do we provide them with access to services and treatment to get them off the street? You can't put a band-aid on this problem....

usually it means they are trapped in a cycle of poverty and living very precariously day to day.  and expecting these people to just be able to drop a deposit on an apartment and pass a background check at the turn of a dime is naive, and being homeless is a factor in stress and stress is a cause of many mental illnesses.  however the word "chronic" isn't strictly limited to medical conditions, shocking i know.

&gt;I would rather spend my tax dollars rehabilitating drug addicts and the morbidly obese than simply resuscitating

You realize drug addicts don't usually collect government handouts, specialized door frames, motorized scooters, and copious amounts of medical bills from literally making their livers into foie gras?

Can people realize that stuffing drug addicts and mentally ill, in the same category as gluttons who choose to eat insane amounts of (expensive) food daily is *wrong*? 

It's like saying "well you care about the poor homeless drug addicts on the street, so you should care about people living comfortably on everyone else's dime, sometimes better than those who work their entire lives, choosing to eat whole pizzas (for a snack) to themselves because they're sad about something." Like a sad attempt to make people feel sorry for them. 

Promise you the junkie is going to have a shittier quality of life and less resources to get help. Not to mention their states of mind to even reach out for it.

Does being fat make people sad and anxious? Yeah, and I'm sure it only gets worse the fatter you get. But holy shit, every time you make the wrong decision, it has to be on *you*, society can't afford for half of us to be helpless adult children.

He very probably has a mental illness. According to the [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration](http://homeless.samhsa.gov/ResourceFiles/hrc_factsheet.pdf) 26.2% of all people in homeless shelters on a given night suffer from mental illnesses; having worked at a resource centre for homeless people, I can tell you that among those who do not use shelters for whatever reason, their incidence of mental illness is generally substantially higher.

I deeply respect your ability to not take it personally and keep your composure when someone is spouting vitriol at you. I've been on the receiving end of angry people with schizophrenic disorders before, and I know that it can really be hard to hold yourself back from an angry response.

I know how i treat the homeless, and I feed them, too. I give money out of every paycheck to help them, and there are people who do a shit ton more than me. 


People treat panhanlders like shit, cause a lot of them aren't actually homeless or destitute and its hard to know which is which. also, the homeless can be fucking awful. Someone shits in the alley around the corner of my home. Its not a dirty alley. Its the access to a lot of actually pricey places to live. Its not a dark alley between two buildings. Its pretty open and nice. I have to walk in that alley failry often and at least one week out of the moth there is just a disgusting smell and a huge amount of shit. Human shit, no mistaking. This is right on the sidewalk, not in like bushes. 

Here are some other things I have witnessed hte homeless doing in the past two years alone (since Ive moved to the city).

1. Publicly masturbating (not even on the subway, like a normal pervert)
2. Pissing on a public street into a garden display with no shame (this guy was definitely mentally ill, he was HUGE and kind of scary)
3. Pissing on the floor of a 711 (the dude smelled like urine, and he start pissing himself. He didn't act like he realized, it might just be something he did) -- actually, this is a lie. This happened more than 2 years ago, porbaly more like 4. But in the area I live in now, and I think its funny so ill leave it.
4. Multiple episodes of being acting extremely hostile for no reason.

There are areas where they piss and it always smell like pee, as well. Not out of the way places, and in an area where there is access to public restrooms. The homeless aren't little angels that cause no problems. A lot are assholes. Its not just nice homeless people. Its not really all that unreasonable that people don't want to be pestered by panhandlers or deal with people acting hostile, or digusting.

I say this as someone who devotes half of all my charity to feeding the homeless (the other half goes to planned parenthood, I like to tell myself its paying for abortions cause thats what I really wish I was doing. I rally wish low income women had free access to abortions, it would really eliminate a lot of problems in society). 

also, in my city, when it gets really cold there are lots of services to help the homeless. Hotlines you can call to get help out to them. A lot of the time you can't help the homeless, though. Things like mental illness take a lot of resources and cooperation. Still, Id argue enough isn't being done, but I don't feel some african goat herders can criticize us.

Africans might not understand cause the crazy people they see here just die in africa or get locked up by their families. I guarantee we treat them better. we also support african countries, too. we help poor in other countries.

We own a condo in Santee Village- 2 blocks from Skid Row. I've watched my empathy for Skid Row's residents slowly get sapped away over the past couple years.  Maybe it was seeing all the harassment my wife has endured. Maybe it was that time a homeless drunk guy kicked my 10 lb dog for no apparent reason as we walked by him. Maybe it was those 3 separate times friends of mine were physically assaulted by homeless individuals. Or the never-ending parade of friends and neighbors that gave Downtown a try but in the end had enough and had to leave. Maybe it was those times that we had to call security because we found yet another erratic, mentally ill homeless person that had snuck into our building, wandering the halls and checking for unlocked doors. Or hell, I don't know...maybe it was just catching another person pissing or shitting in the entranceway of our building too many times. Take your pick.

Live here long enough and you will find your empathy being replaced with a sense of self preservation and a sad realization that you've probably made a very bad mistake bringing your family here. But I'm sure you know all that already, right?  After all, if you are in a place where you can objectively call my viewpoint "the worst fucking attitude", than clearly you must also live adjacent to Skid Row as well, right? Otherwise, you'd just be talking out of your ass.

If that's the stereotype, then the stereotype is pretty inaccurate - get on NextDoor sometime (good for yard sales, bad for faith in humanity) in any neighborhood with any homeless population. I live in Los Feliz (my flair is for where I'm moving to next week) and my local NextDoor has a new thread every day asking "What can we do to get rid of the homeless in this neighborhood?" I even saw one that included the sentence "Don't post anything about sympathizing with them or offering them food or housing, I just want to know who to call to make them GO AWAY."

Yes, I am young with no kids. I walk in my neighborhood every night at night and I often bring food to the local homeless people. One of the homeless gentlemen in my neighborhood made international news recently when he saved over $300 given to him and donated it to Our Mother of God Catholic Church to help repay them for the lunches they have been feeding him every day for years. He is a Vietnam veteran of the Marine Corps who was unable to retain housing after his wife died and left him without a caregiver to assist with the symptoms of TBI.

I have been yelled at now and then and had one high off his ass homeless guy offer me a "piece of meat for the dog" (I was walking a dog) and point to his dick - but I don't expect to live in an urban area with one of the highest homeless populations in America and never see or hear something that makes me uncomfortable. 

There is NO mental health care system for the working class in America, much less people truly living in poverty. Blaming individuals who are mentally ill or brain-injured (some studies say up to 80% of unhoused people have TBI) for this fact is like blaming people in Syria for being sloppy builders when you look at the ruins of buildings bombed during their civil war. People who are both poor and mentally ill in America are under active attack by a system that is happier to kill them than to treat them, and you're acting like they chose that because they are evil and wish to hurt you.

Statistics do not support homeless-phobia. The homeless and the mentally ill are two groups MUCH more likely to be victims of a violent crime than to be perpetrators. And, if you were to be a victim of a violent crime, science also tells us that the most likely perpetrators are your friends and immediate family. Stranger assaults are extremely rare compared to domestic violence. Mugging is extremely rare compared to "friends" pocketing the credit cards from your purse. To reduce your risk of being a victim of crime, be selective about who you associate closely with. Avoiding contact with the homeless has much lower ROI when attempting to reduce your risk of crime.

I was at the Jamba Juice by Costco on Los Feliz Blvd. the other day and a homeless man asked me if he could have a dollar. I didn't have any cash on me, so I offered him a meal - he accepted with thanks and asked for a california roll from the California Roll Sushi and a Pepsi. There must have been 50-75 people eating outdoors looking right at this polite, well-spoken senior citizen who was obviously hungry and obviously homeless, and he had not yet been offered a meal. 

And I bet every single one of those people, if you ask them whether or not they help the homeless, will say, "Oh, I'd give them food, but they only want money for booze and drugs. They'll turn down food if you offer it."

I have had the wonderfully good fortune since moving to LA to get to know some unique and fascinating people who are currently coping with homelessness. For example, Amos (the StreetWiseLA guy) is an absolutely charming, funny, and obviously mentally ill man who will probably never be fully self-supporting, but works incredibly hard to do his best with what he has. Another lovely woman I met, who lives on Skid Row, is a trans woman of color who has multiple disabling physical conditions and attempted suicide when her trans identity led to bullying and sexual assault. She is fortunate to be someone with a high ceiling - while her health will never be good, she has the capacity to secure permanent housing. Or GodBody, who was released from jail on the Friday before a long weekend despite BEGGING them to keep him just until Tuesday so he wouldn't go three days without supportive services before he could call his caseworker. He was so frustrated when I spoke to him - he told me, "I don't want to get high to stay awake and I don't want to sleep on Skid Row, but what am I gonna do? If I go to iHop and sleep in a booth they kick me out. If I go to a friend's house with money in my pocket, they're going to call someone over who sells drugs and I'm gonna end up getting high. If I could call my caseworker, I could get a place to sleep in a shelter tonight." In spite of dealing with that situation, he didn't want money, food, or any material help. He just wanted a turn on my skateboard, not having ridden one since he was incarcerated. He returned it after a quick spin and promised me he'd keep his head up. (A friend of mine ran into him a few weeks later - he told my friend he was clean still, but he also remembered me as Asian, which I'm not, so it's doubtful...)

There's also the data point that the chronically homeless, while more common in LA, are still a tiny subset of the overall homeless population. Far more common are families experiencing temporary homelessness and chronic housing insecurity. The upcoming documentary [Lost In America](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lost-in-america--5#home) (IndieGoGo link) explores the situation of homeless teens, many of whom are GLBTIA identified and have lost their family's support due to coming out of the closet. And there are plenty of working people holding down a minimum-wage job and sleeping in cars or on the street.

Fear/hatred of the homeless isn't just compassionless, it's not scientifically supportable, not based on a rational conceptualization of who "the homeless" are, and not productive even in the most callous sense. Short of mass executions, you can't get rid of homelessness without providing more safe housing, food, and medical care. Resenting them and neglecting to support safer solutions for community living won't reduce the number of people sleeping outdoors in your neighborhood, and it certainly won't do anything to keep away the tiny minority of them who mean to harm you.

Is this Christian damage control, blaming atheists for this when the article didn't mention a single thing about atheism?

Do you associate atheism with liberalism because it explains your rampant stupidity?

I tried being a shitlord and posted this on the page, but apparently SJWs love being censor happy. (I got banned from the event)

&gt;I thought this event was satire, but apparently it isn't. With that in mind...

&gt;I've seen these type of arguments rise up from time to time, but with "patriarchy" instead of the Greek system. Likewise, the tenets of these arguments are fairly similar: 

&gt;1) "patriarchy" / Greek system is racist towards PoC (People of Color, whatever you want that to mean. White is a color last time I checked). Several individuals have posted here saying that the Greek system is not in fact racist, but rather welcoming and nurturing. But by responding with "#notallgreeks" or the like, if you find one anecdote that supports your position, whether true or false, then we cannot proceed. After all, we can only speak for ourselves, so why not find the problematic persons individually rather than knocking on the doors of the nebulous Greek system as a whole?

&gt;2) The whole concept of definitions. Generally, dictionaries contain both the historical definition of a word and also the modern, colloquial definition. For example, "literally" means "in a literal manner or sense; exactly" but also has a secondary definition that mirrors "figuratively". Likewise, the generally agreed upon definition of racism, both historically and colloquially, is contained within the dictionary. That is, until the general, colloquial changes.

&gt;3) Privilege. After all, this is what this party is about, right? I'd be lying if I said everyone was absolutely equal. Some of us are more disadvantaged than others. However, not all privilege can be seen on the outside. Some of us may have problems back home, others mental illness that cannot be seen. But just because a person looks like they have more privilege doesn't mean they do, and regardless of privilege, their arguments are not immediately invalid. Likewise, just because someone is underprivileged doesn't mean any arguments of theirs are automatically valid. Look at me for instance. If you know my background, I grew up in Bellevue in an affluent community. You may jump to conclusions and say that I'm privileged and therefore do not know the struggle of minorities. But this past summer, my entire family, minus my brother and I, had to move back to Korea due to visa issues. This past year was difficult; not only was it my first year at the UW, but I had to be my family's legal liaison, working at my parent's store to compensate for their absence. Hence why comments such as "oh you're asian you don't know the struggle of *real* minorities" irritate me.

&gt;4) "Educating". My main issue with proponents of this event comes around to this. It kind of reminds me of the nebulous nature of Scientology. Ask any Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Atheist, etc. to describe what they believe, and you'll usually receive a satisfying, succinct answer in a minute or so. However, like Scientology, proponents of this event are refusing to move beyond surface level explanations. When members of the Greek system are genuinely concerned and curious as to why this event is necessary, and get answers of "educate yourself white shitlord" or the like in response, they're not wrong to be mildly frustrated. Even those annoying guys in red square are vocal about what they believe in (however crazy such ideas might be), unlike several people on this page. What would happen if the Mormon missionaries said "I'm Elder John, and you should educate yourself heathen"?

&gt;5) The idea that "whites are never minorities, and blacks are always the minority". This may be true in some times in some places, but not always. Also note how this conveniently leaves out members of other races and those of mixed origin. If you really want a place where "black privilege" exists, then I'll point you towards the wonderful land of Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe accuses his opposition (some of them former colonists) of being promoters of white imperialism. As such, he promoted law banning whites from owning any lands and businesses, and redistributed them to native blacks, without any compensation to the former owners. Yet I hear no outcry about this, and why is that?

&gt;This post is way too long, so I'll end this with a "Go Dawgs!"

&gt;TL;DR: Check your privilege /s

I'm someone who feeds the homeless quite a bit. I never give them money, but I buy extra food and hand it out. Look most of these guys have mental illnesses or have just flat out gave up on life. I've offered some to stay and if they need any help. But they're not interested. Most, not all, just want some money for glue or booze. That's there happy place.

Edit: Wow, thank-you so much for the Gold, but honestly more of us should do this. If you're walking in town and go to the bakery or something, especially in winter, just buy a few extra and hand them out to those who need them. Usually helps them sober up a bit and sends the message that society still cares.

Like mugenhunt said. Homelessness is a social problem that we largely created ourselves. In the 1980s, deinstituionalization happened where we removed severely mentally ill people from mental health hospitals. Granted, the institutions were horrible in the 50s, but it was an overreaction because the institutions were becoming much more humane by that point. 

Just pushing mentally ill people on the streets, of course, didn't make them any more able to survive, hold a job and get a place. So they're homeless. And a lot are also drug users or alcoholics. It's a form of self-medication. Using drugs and alcohol is something some of them do to run from their symptoms.

[In the 2010's many homeless are actually sober, drug-free people who want jobs but fail to get them](http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/employment.html). In decades past, yes, maybe drug addiction, alcoholism, and mental illness were the primary factors. Times have changed.

The only time I heard of these freeman/sovereign citizen types in real life, it was from homeless dudes. Take no formal education, a dash of mental illness, and a couple decades of all your interactions with cops ending poorly no matter what you believe, you get ideas like this. This idea appeals only to people who are unable to function in society, they are  crazy and just want to be left alone. They don't want to hang out with other crazies at the homeless shelter, those crazy fucks steal their shit and talk their crazy shit constantly and start fights. They want to just eat other peoples leftovers and sleep at the park and the cops keep fucking with them. 

I'm kind of amazed that the idea has spread to people who can basically function in society, with the exception of their ability to park motorhomes. 
<TRUE>

Isn't that kind of the idea? They'll use their free money to buy residence, transportation, and sustenance and suddenly become indistinguishable from existing populace. If a UBI is going to work and be as cost effective as people hope, it's going to need to work for exactly these people. 

In any case, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't the kind of tidal wave you're thinking of, as many people are homeless for reasons beyond the lack of a social safety net (poorly educated, mental illness, unaware of programs designed to help). I'd think many of those cases would continue to exist. 
<TRUE>

Great question.  I'm definitely not an expert.

The solution isn't easy, since it is mostly caused by a disparity of wealth, poor attitudes towards mental health and poor support for social services.   

So I guess:

Vote for whomever will work to fix social services and health care.

Support the right to basic housing and income.

Stop using housing as an investment. 

Support community organizations who work with low income, homeless, mentally ill, down on their luck....   

I carry a paper with a list of resources with free/cheap meals.  There are lots of great places, and quite a few shitty places to get food and clothes.  Most of the people I talk to already know the resources.

Ask small towns around Toronto to stop dumping their homeless people on us.  

Wish I had the answer.

Blaze Foley, Homeless singer who patched his cloths up with duct tape and lived off the streets of Austin. Most of the money he made went to recording albums but for the most part they ended up getting unrelesed or lost (DEA busted studio and seized master tapes for 1, another one the master tapes got lost in a flood, and the master tapes to a 3rd one got stolen out of his car). Then he was murdered by his friends son. after they buried him they had to dig him back up to get the pawn ticket for his guitar which they accidental left in his pocket. some people also think he may have been slightly mentally ill aswell.

This may be a complicated situation.  Severe mental illness is a major factor for many homeless people.  Some people may be so "crazy" that they can't handle the situation the owner is setting up (coming in and asking for a meal), and for others a lifetime of "acting crazy" has caused the people around them to respond with fear and anger, again making that person reluctant to come in.

It really is great that the owner of this restaurant is doing it, even if the person who visits the dumpster can't handle going in.  But overall the solution is that we in the US do a terrible job caring for people with mental illness and we need to fix that.

Yes. Panhandlers can often make much more than minimum wage by panhandling and pretending to be homeless.  This law helps remove the financial incentive to be a full-time panhandler on a corner. After reading busker journals, I learned you could make enough to live on begging an hour a day. 


However, we do need effective help for our homeless and mentally ill, which this law doesn't address.  We also need to discourage begging as a chosen profession, which this law does address.

Oh child, he said, they have been troubling you for so long. How can you stand it? His voice reminded her of a gurgling stream, guttural but smooth and kind. You can’t survive without help much longer, he continued. You will sleep and they will steal away all your beauty again.

She felt his leathery soft hand touch her cheek and she recoiled at the warmth. She took a step back, looking into his eyes again. 

What? Sanya asked. Who are *they*? 

His eyes were full of sorrow. The nightmares, the creatures, he explained. I can see them haunting you. Please, let me help you. 

Sanya took another step back away from him, suddenly noting the madness in his eyes. Now she realized why he seemed so blissfully content. He was crazy! Crazy! Crazy! Crazy! Nothing but a crazy homeless man. She turned and ran away from him and sprinted toward her office.

She heard his voice call after her. Don’t sleep! Whatever you do, don’t sleep! But she kept running until she slammed the doors of her workspace behind her. She gasped for breath and waited until her heartrate returned to normal before walking over to her desk and sitting down and cradling her head in her hands. Why was she letting a mentally ill homeless man bother her? He was just a harmless old fool that had no idea what he was talking about. But how did he know she didn’t sleep? Maybe there was some truth in his words

but that was a ludicrous notion. Of course he’d know she wasn’t sleeping well. Everyone always commented she looked haggard and sick. You’d never need to be psychic to know she didn’t sleep well and the thought of nightmares troubling her was laughable. She wasn’t a child afraid of what was hidden in the dark. 

And so the rest of her day passed without incident. Sanya waited for lunch waited for the end of the work day and waited to go to bed. When the time came to take her sleeping pills she thought of the homeless man and his warning but he was just insane. Why shouldn’t she sleep? That’s what she wanted, what she deserved, what she earned with her day’s work. 

So she grinded up a double dose for her drink and lay down in her bed to await the embrace of slumber. You never really recall the exact moment you fall asleep. You  look at the wall, the ceiling, you shift to look at the clock, you listen to the sounds of passing traffic in the distance and its Doppler effect, and count the stars you can see outside your window before a cloud drifts over your view of the heavens, and then you look at the clock again and see only a few minutes have passed, or maybe an hour but time is an arbitrary human construct so it doesn’t even matter and you don’t even know if you were awake the entire time or fell asleep for a bit without realizing. Then there are whispers, whispers and haunting thoughts and new images to look at. The stars outside the window spread out to cover the entire sky and all Sanya could see were the beautiful bits of Heaven peeking through the vibrant indigo fabric. Colors swirled and the stars waltzed into wondrous shapes – geometric figures never seen before, animals and plants evolution had yet to conceive, stories yet to be written or drawn. The stars changed colors so flecks of gold, emerald, magenta, maroon, and turquoise floated down and illuminated the hills and valleys and rivers in the distance and she moved among the lights so that her feet barely touched the ground. 

So many ideas flourished in that little paradise and Sanya wondered how she’d ever struggled to paint at all. It seemed so easy now, and she wielded a brush in her hand and decorated the grasses and forests in her image, highlighting their natural beauty with an accent of ingenuity. But then a cold breeze chilled her to the bone and a tingle rushed up her spine that froze her in place, and all she could do was look up toward the sky. The stars were fading away, being consumed by a pitch black stain spreading out, encroaching on her art and all Sanya could do was stare at it helplessly. The colors turned black and the valleys and forests faded away until she couldn’t remember what anything looked like anymore except the ominous malicious darkness looming over her bead. And she could do nothing but stare into the emptiness that subsumed her best creation and left her with nothing but the rank smell of fear that petrified her to the core. The mass opened two luminous yellow eyes and examined Sanya with an apathetic stare before slowly retreating into the darkness of her closet and disappearing from view. 

She lay there fighting panicky breaths and tears springing into her eyes as she waited for the invisible weights on her body to subside. For hours she laid there, heart thumping wildly and she urgently tried to recall her dream, but there was nothing but the horrid blackness and the terror. The terror. The terror of sleeping. The terror of It. An eternity later she could move her limbs and she jumped out of her bed and dressed, ignorant of the hour. She tripped over her belongings as she clambered out of her door, ignoring her neighbor reaching out to her. She ran down the stairs out of her apartments. She ignored the fiery in her chest as she ran toward her office, praying, praying that some force was looking out for her. 

Until finally she found what she was looking for, sitting under a yellow lamplight. Sanya ran and fell down beside the lamp post and stared into the soul of the one thing that could help her. 

Please, she whispered. Please, please. Help me. Help me.

Istanbul has essentially *no* homeless people. Turkish culture is such that it would be a shame on the family if anyone did not have someplace to live. It's not unusual for men in their mid-30s that don't have a job to still live with their parents, and it's not a source of shame like it might be in the US.

Also, many homeless are victims of Schizophrenia or similar mental illnesses. I've heard it said that the problem with such diseases is that they are too much for just one caregiver to handle. So if you are a guy, get married, then come down with Schizophrenia (it usually strikes men in their 30s), it's unreasonable to expect your wife to be able to care for you on her own, so you might end up homeless. Again, this is less of an issue in Turkey because extended families tend to stay very close and support each other. Rarely will children move more that 1hrs drive from their parents.

I'm in the process of becoming a teacher for a [Clubhouse program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clubhouse_Model_of_Psychosocial_Rehabilitation) in a low-income, urban area. Considering that I'm working with people with mental illness to transition back into society/workplace,  do I count it as non-clinical or clinical volunteering?
<TRUE>

While that is a factor, I don't think it's the only one. You see similar behavior from people (at least in Canada and US) of varying genders, races, topics. But almost exclusively among the middle class, and I guess a bit above. 

I mean my Facebook feed is filled with shit that, while not SJWisms, is along the same self serving bullshit, and it's roughly split between men and women. 

Where people love feeling like they matter, like they're helping out the underdog, and will focus on easy, band aid solutions that can see immediate or quick impact, but often are entirely missing the core problem. 

In a nutshell it's like giving $10 to a homeless person on the street. 

You're not really helping them, not long term anyway, and certainly have done nothing to tackle issues with homelessness or mental illness or income inequality. 

But for that five minutes or that day, you get to pat yourself on the back and feel good about yourself when it's really just narcissism, or at least selfish. 

I mean $10? Sure, that's a lunch. But no real dent in a working person's pocket. Why not give $100? $500? Something that will actually pact you, a real sacrifice.

But people won't do that. Not most people anyway. They're not in it to actually help people or better the world. They're just in it enough to feel like they have, and benefit from the sensation. 

It's getting to call yourself a fan and participate jn the championship parade, but never having to really watch the games or suffer in defeat. You throw on a hat, yell "go team!" and benefit all the same.

A lot of times, people are homeless due to mental illness. Since you don't know who is mentally ill at a food bank and who just fell on hard times, it's nice to give the benefit of the doubt. Until they get belligerent or physical...

I really wish I could disagree with you but in my state we have terrible resources for the mentally ill. I saw it with my brother, actually. So many of the mentally ill here are homeless and cannot afford to pay for their meds, so even when they get committed they often can't keep up on everything anyway. 

I wish my state had more resources. I still think it's worth it to get people help, but it's definitely a repeating cycle for many people.

My dad owns his own business, and has a decent sized shed out the back of his premises with old stuff in there like mattresses, furniture etc.

There are often homeless people around the area and one had kind of made up a little base inside the shed. One weekend I was going to help him clear the shed out of some junk and tidy it up a bit, and we found Nick resting on one of the mattresses next to his small stash of personal stuff. He apologised for breaking in, but dad said not to worry about it. He offered Nick some cash to help me clear out the shed with him, and bought Nick and I a sandwich each from the market across the road for lunch. Nick told me about how he was kicked out of home when he was fairly young because he was smoking weed and his parents found out and basically didn't want to know him anymore, how he suffers from mental illness and how it led to him living on the streets.

We finished the tidy up quite fast since Nick helped us, so dad went back to the market and bought Nick a new jacket, pants, and some sturdy shoes. Nick was clearly very happy with his new clothing and sandwich, I felt proud to be my father's son.

This all happened when I was about 14/15 years old, and it had a huge effect on how I viewed homeless people from that stage on.

Yea, poor people act similarily everywhere. That's because the reason they are poor have similar systemic reasons everywhere.

Citing a mentally ill person as evidence isn't an argument. He should have received proper treatment.

I feel really bad for her. It would seem she would have to be homeless or mentally ill or both. It would never occur to a sane person to walk around like that, but maybe I'm just giving her too much credit.

Are you kidding? 
First, scratch off bus driver, your naivety doesn't realize they are Union...they are WELL off, my father was a bus driver

As for Janitor and wal mart greeter 
That person gets a refund in April, pays little tax, and if need be has free medical, free food, subsidized housing and help for paying heat and electricity.  No, they are NOT a doctor, very observant, but they are not the single mom with 3 kids and eating cat food as people who never been in poverty wish to profess

We take care of our poor pretty decently in America,

except for our Veterans and mentally ill, which we leave for dead and most are homeless...

We could change that, but we keep arguing over this shit

Sometimes, people choose to be homeless. Sometimes, people are dangerous and you have to cut them out of your life. Sometimes, people don't want you to help them. Sometimes people are not in a place where you can help them, either physically or mentally. There are all kinds of reasons as to why /u/ladyalthea is unable to support her son right now, especially if he has a mental illness.

I feel like I should elaborate a bit more.

&gt; Is it possible to be genuinely homeless in Montreal?

Yes it's definitely possible through a concourse of circumstances to end up in street. Sometimes it's extreme mental illness, sometimes it's more nuanced than that. If you fall through the cracks of unemployment and disability you will end up with Bien-être Social (BS) which really isn't much. Something around 500$/mo. So happens that now you can't afford your appartment and you get evicted. Good luck finding a place you can afford for that much. Even with roommate it won't be easy. Students who live frugally usually live on an income of maybe $9~15K. At 6000$/year you're really not well situated.

So now you have nowhere to live, no fixed address, and can't recieve BS anymore. You're done, you're in the streets. If you had preconditions leading to mental illness... well you can guess what happens next.

Then there's first nations who are overly represented in the homeless population. They usually battle addiction problems, come to the big city to seek a better life. Sometimes escaping difficult familial situations, violence, more addiction etc. But they arrive here with absolutely zero wealth, no education, no skills. They quickly have difficulty finding employment and battling addicition and end up in the streets.

&gt; Surely this city cannot have a population sleeping rough given the temperatures I've experienced this February.

There are definitely less beds than there are homeless, so yes people sleep outside in the freezing temperatures. Plus those who have mental illness are sometimes mentally incapable to get in the shelters where it's packed with other people.

What was this homeless "camper" up to? Something nefarious? Surely they didn't just waltz up and kill him. Oh, I get it. He pulled two KNIVES on them, rather than surrender. He got what he deserved!

"Crazy" (mentally ill) IS NOT be a defense to pulling a weapon on a cop. DO NOT pull a weapon on a cop. They face that life risk EVERY DAY, they are under NO obligation to react as recommended by STUPID ASSED CANDY BRAINED CITIZENS who DO NOT live that life.

If someone you know is crazy...make SURE they know NOT to pull a weapon on a cop, unless they WANT to die. Otherwise before you know it ALL criminals will claim crazy, and pull weapons on cops rather than surrender.

Just because you're crazy does NOT mean you are not a threat to a cop's life. He/she does NOT have to "stand down" because you are a stupid asswipe, probably crazy due to your OWN (or your parents') stupid choices in life.

I can't BELIEVE you stupid shits on this thread claiming "mentally ill" means FREE PASS to pull a weapon or resist arrest!!! That is the most STUPID thing I've heard in a while.

20 to 25% of homeless are severely mentally ill.
