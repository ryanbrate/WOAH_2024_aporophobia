&gt; I identify as a libertarian, and for some god forsaken reason, Sanders is my #1 pick at this point.

You wouldn't be the first libertarian to say that.

&gt; Now Sanders has some very socialist policies, which scares me.

I don't think so. Really serious socialism would be looking to seize all private business and turn it over to workers, or perhaps the state. What Bernie wants is to basically maintain capitalism with all its familiar flaws and benefits, just with a bit of a tighter fence built around it to reduce wealth inequality, limit the ability of the ultra-wealthy to corrupt democracy, and protect the working and middle classes.

I mean, he's not even talking about instituting a basic income. He's really very moderate.

Look at countries he wants to emulate, like Sweden. Sure, taxes are higher there. But the people also live better, and there's no Stalinist regime. Those countries are very democratic.

&gt; This would raise wages for those who are able to find a job, but it would raise unemployment and cause inflation, bringing us right back to where we were at the start.

The purpose of a business is to create wealth. If a business doesn't create enough wealth to support its own employees, that business is a failure, a leech on the economy, and a waste of productive capital. Wouldn't you agree?

In truth, most businesses can absorb wage increases. It's been estimated that doubling McDonalds wages would only add cents to the cost of their burgers, for instance. And some companies are voluntarily increasing the lowest wages they pay. Aetna jumped from $12 to $16. A payment processing company in Seattle, Gravity Payments, started paying all its employees a minimum of $70k/year, which is more than double what they were previously being paid. Costco has paid its employees wages starting in the upper teens for years.

Cities that have passed minimum wage increases are not seeing the huge price increases, layoffs, or loss of business that critics predicted.

As for unemployment: wealthy employers don't create jobs, demand does. Without demand, businesses close. With it, they expand. When people have more income, they consume more. This provides a boost to businesses; small ones see the benefit of increased volume to offset their increased wage overhead, and big ones hire more to meet demand.

&gt; Pay equity for women

As long as no one actually tries to pass a law forcing employers to pay women more than men - and Bernie has never proposed or supported such a bill, as far as I know - I don't think you need to worry.

&gt; Affordable education for all ... I support this whole-heartedly, but how exactly would he go about doing this?

As far as I know, he wants to raise taxes, eliminate tax loopholes for the rich and rein in corporate subsidies and military spending. That would easily free up hundreds of billions of dollars.

&gt; Similarly, a few other things like Tax Reform, Expanding welfare, and increased Union rights could be disasterous if not implemented carefully. Where can i find more info on his plans for these?

I don't have any good links handy, but there's a good chance you'll find him talking about these things in any speech or interview he's given in the past 30 years.

They wouldn't be disastrous. The top tax bracket in 1950 was 84%. In 1960 it was __91%__. In 1970 it was 71%. In 1980 it was 70%.

Those tax rates didn't destroy us. They didn't destroy American business. The Laffer Curve isn't actually a wrong idea, but no one actually knows where the "taxes are too high and they're stifling production" point is, and it's probably much higher than where our taxes are currently set.

&gt; I'm worried that he's just a socialist demagogue trying to vastly increase the reliance of poor people on the state.

That doesn't make any sense. He's trying to empower workers and give them a more level playing field in business and government. If he's successful, they will be _less_ reliant on the state for everything except what the state is supposed to provide: security and justice.

Well, and education and medicine. If he had his way, the state would be providing those. But if you look at other countries with socialized medicine, they all spend less and get better outcomes than we do. I don't know of many countries with free higher ed - Germany is one - but as far as I know it works pretty well.

So, what, you're saying that they still might have refused to serve a homeless man, and only served them AFTER the dispute? But then what about-

There is a big difference between someone who is chronically homeless and people who are temporarily homeless, or in danger of becoming homeless. People who are chronically homeless often have some problem that they can't get help for that makes it hard for them to function. But there are homeless people that are even employed. This is actually common in the fast food industry. Next time you go through the drive-through at Taco Bell, any one of the people working back there may actually be crashing at a friend's place or even living on the street temporarily.

Safety nets in the US are not available to the kind of homeless people you are talking about, as they usually do not qualify for one reason or another. In order to get unemployment benefits for instance, you usually must have been laid off, meaning you could not have quit on you own volition or have been fired. The people you are talking about get fired. They do not hold down a job well, they stop showing up because of one problem or another, or they get fired because they cannot function as an employee very well. They don't get laid off.

In order to collect food stamps, one must be employed. I have received food stamps before, I also applied for heating assistance. There was no crisis going on. I did not have a medical bill to pay, I didn't have to drop money to repair a car or anything like that. I just couldn't afford to make ends meet to the point that things were getting dangerously close to the point that if anything did happen, I would be unable to pay rent or bills on time, or groceries or gas(usually to get to work! go figure!) even though I had a full time job at $12 per hour. Where I live was just too expensive(not the rent, but everything in general) I have no kids and my girlfriend and I live together and pay half each on our expenses. When I worked for Sam's Club in my teenage years, I remember the break room would have pamphlets and application forms for food stamps and stuff like that. Getting their employees on government assistance was always a part of their strategy to supplement their income without having to actually pay them a living wage. The same thing one could think in addition to guessing who in the fast food restaurant is homeless as I mentioned before, is to look around and notice that they are all paid really low wages, and most of them look for OT, and it becomes clear that even though they are employed, there is no possible way that they are supporting themselves on their wages alone. The biggest tragedy in regards to food stamps is that those who have to use them are already working for a living, yet still need help making ends meet. Chronically homeless as you describe are not employed in this way. So this doesn't apply to the people you're talking about either.

So these benefits don't go to people who are chronically homeless because of mental illness, but to people who would otherwise be fine, but are experiencing a cash flow problem. It is unfortunate in my opinion, but the people you are describing hardly get any support in any way. The safety net in the US is designed more for people that /u/NotanotherYank is describing, as the stipulations that define whether or not one is eligible is usually based on some kind of model poor person or "honest poor" that is invented solely from the mind of people that are well positioned enough in the economy that they will never have to engage with these safety nets or the reasons why they are there in the first place, except in some abstract ethics exercise.

There is a *huge* difference between a family that doesn't have cars and lives only within walking distance of a McDonald's, and a family that doesn't have cars and lives within walking distance of a grocery store *and* a McDonald's, and only ever goes to the McDonald's. I'm pretty sure the OP is talking about the latter, not the former. Of course we should have compassion for the truly deprived. But there are a huge number of "poor people" who have the ability to change their situation, and not only do they not do so, they get angry when someone tries to give them an empowering message that would end their perpetual victimhood. People like that don't need alms. Their problem is psychological and spiritual.

Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It really depends on the situation.

Where I went to college there was a street nearby that had a lot of homeless people. Some were actually really nice and helpful, wanting to earn what they asked for. Those are the ones that I'd be more likely to give money to.

Even if you don't give money though, don't be a dick. I remember there was one day when I was going down that street and passed by a fast food restaurant. There was a guy sitting on the patio eating, he was incredibly happy that he'd gotten enough money for a full meal and was just spreading the happiness. He was asking people walking by for a smile and silly things like that. Really nice, wasn't actually bothering anyone. Some dick walked by and the homeless man asked him for a smile and he started yelling and cussing at him instead.

So, yeah, even if you don't give money, just don't be a dick.

Wal-Mart has cornered the market of providing a lot of  cheap generic shit to the low-income portion of the population. Same with McDonalds. However, they are both losing more and more customers to companies like Target, Publix, AMAZON, and really ANY other fast food giant in America. Honestly, it just took getting through the Recession for most Americans to become fatigued by these big corporations. Americans are willing to pay a higher price for a better experience. And as of right now, McDonalds serves its purpose (Cheap food that you eat b/c you have to). And Wal-Mart serves its purpose (Cheap products that you buy because they're cheap).

Freddie Gray didn't commit a crime, and yet he's dead. As for people who actually do commit crime, every other developed country in the world is capable of arresting people (even those who resit arrest) without killing them in droves like we do in the States.

And the museum professionals in there for the places that even report more than $10k / yr sporting masters and PhDs degrees are being paid not much more than Starbucks and McDonalds employees all the time. Ignore the BLS statistics for museum professionals, they are stilted for the government jobs in the DC area with the major institutions like Smithsonian or the National Park Service that tend to employ literally the world's foremost authorities on really narrow topics oftentimes. It is truly an entirely prestige-only, low-pay job, and is correlated very strongly with the difficulties of academia careers today.

I would bet a pretty solid amount of cash that the *actual* museum jobs out there (as opposed to volunteers) for places that aren't just tax shelters or government grant suck-ups (I am first-hand aware of at least 10+ "museums" that violate their federal grants routinely) are a small fraction of what's available for jobs at Starbucks and McDonalds. In fact, I've heard of many museum professionals having to work at Starbucks for side cash and benefits because of furloughs and deep funding cuts while the same places will be hiring for baristas, cooks, and security guards at the cafe. Everyone at the major museums I've talked to have agreed beyond a doubt that the security guards are paid on average better than the curators and collections administrators.

These sorts of articles that show up every year or so that try to make the numbers of people visiting libraries and museums that much more relevant are such horseshit to much it's not even funny anymore. It's about as lame and transparent to me now as those "ten best places to retire!" linkbait articles.

The best way to support real museums in my opinion is to write to congressmen and keep them from cutting museum funding. Also, don't bother with even visiting them oftentimes - they oftentimes don't even charge money or almost break even. Museum funding is not like a business at all and is primarily driven through how well the grant writers there can find a solid funding vehicle (say, DoD where $1M is a random paper pusher or two and a bargain for 6 FTEs) or the museum director is cushy with the few corporate and estate donors that donate to the arts anymore.

Source: I am married to a 10-year+ museum professional and have suffered with her and her peers' career struggles coast to coast in the US despite insane amounts of dedication. There are no jobs, only broken dreams and bitterness. The only happy people have wealthy spouses supporting them and don't mind it or are already 30+ years into a federal career as a GS-15+.

I don't understand your reasoning that “convenience” is the reason why family- run shops are on the decline. Local businesses are generally not going out of business for lack of customers, but moreso due to skyrocketing rents.

A major reason locally-owned businesses are on the decline is government-developer collusion. The Urban Renewal Authority Ordinance, for example, is a tool providing a simplified land resumption process for developers to profit upon valuable urban land which would otherwise be difficult to assemble by virtue of the fact that flats in old buildings are all individually owned. Cheap shop space in places under redevelopment, like Kwun Tong, is demolished en masse and replaced with massive high-rent shopping centres outside the means of small entrepreneurs and which lease to big chains in bulk at a discount.

Another reason is the concentrated ownership of retail space in new towns, which is also related to government-developer collusion. In places like Tseung Kwan O and Tin Shui Wai, the retail space is all held by a few property giants in the form of shopping malls. In the latter case,  Cheung Kong actually made a secret agreement with the government that the Housing Authority shopping centres there would not be poised to compete with Cheung Kong shopping centres. 

Ironically, when all Housing Authority shopping centres were divested to The Link REIT in ~2005 they have become unaffordable to small retailers also. They used to be filled with family owned shops, but The Link embarked on a renovation programme to attract higher-paying chains,  kicking out all the old local retailers in the process. Now every single housing estate shopping centre is the same bland mix of McDonald's,  ParkNShop, etc.

Yet you still have a demand for affordable retail space in the new towns, so you get poor people hawking at the “dawn markets” in Tin Shui Wai and being chased away and harassed by FEHD officers at 8AM.

Then there is the “spatial monopoly” of private developers, not only in that they own all the new town retail space, but provide space for the expansion of their own chains (i.e. ParkNShop, owned by Cheung Kong) while prospective competitors like Carrefour can't find spaces large enough to compete.

Then you have random other private landlords evicting all the local shops in order to attract high value tenants serving mainland tourists,  such as Marina Square in South Horizons last year which evicted 30 retailers

Running a shop used to be a viable way for Hong Kong low-income people to move up in the world. Now there is little fairness in the system. I really recommend reading “Land and the Ruling Class in Hong Kong” by Alice Poon for more on the subject.

An uber driver is a contract worker who does relatively poorly because he either overestimated the value of his skilled work on the open market or he wasn't skilled enough to find a higher paying job under the employ of a cab service.  If he built his own car service from the ground up or successfully contracted himself out as a chauffeur to wealthy individuals through contacts, the reward would match the increased risk of his endeavor.  This doesn't have anything to do with minimum wage as it is skilled work.

As for your expansion argument, I wasn't talking conceptually.  As a business owner, your job is to expand your business.  That's what being a business owner is, as much as being a fry cook is flipping burgers in the back of a McDonald's.  If you're content with owning a stagnant business that pays the bills despite the increased risk in terms of financial insecurity, then yeah, I agree that there's no reason not to be a manager at a larger company where you would oversee the same level of operation.

"Expanding skills" by going to college not only assumes that college is a financial reality open to everyone, but it also entails a change in the unskilled employee's line of work, which is the opposite of what I was talking about.  And again, minimum wage isn't about workers' entitlement, it's a regulation on companies relying on unskilled labor.  It doesn't even apply to most businesses, as it can only be abused if there is a functionally unlimited pool of workers who are also expendable toward your company's operations.

I also see how they try and cause millions of milk cows physical harm by getting laws in place that keep those cows from being milked. I also know that they advocate for testing pharmacuticals on unwilling and unknowing humans rather than animals.

I also know that they deplore the use of fur coats, while at the same time purchasing thousands of fur coats to give away to the homeless as a deterrent for rich people to wear them. 

I also know how they run porn sites that switch videos to show animal cruelty and torture, videos they sat and recorded but did nothing to actually stop. I also know how they attack children's games, like Pokemon and Super Mario, in an attempt to destroy childhoods around the world. I also see on their website where they want to take away pets from all owners, and sterilize all pets into extinction, while demanding that dogs and cats be fed a vegan only diet. 

In their words: “The selfish desire to possess animals and receive love from them causes immeasurable suffering.". And that's not even getting into the death threats, assaults, torture, and murders that PETA members have committed against their fellow humans in an attempt to save animals lives.

Disclaimer: You may be talking about Detroit, I would like to point out that I  have no experience with Detroit but will do my best to relay what I do know about these topics

1. Semi- conceded, its really hard to get home and back on a lunch break but that doesn't mean that you can't bring food from home and put it in a fridge, even the Walmart "Express" I worked at had a fridge and break room

2. If you are set on eating fast food then yes produce and fresh food is almost impossible to come by. Like I said before bring your own food to work

3. I have no experience with any company making me work over 80 hours, when I worked at that Walmart I was lucky to get 25 hours a week and most internships cap you at 30-40 hours (mine have all been 30, they basically get 10 hours free)

4. There are also things called sidewalks, basketball courts and swimming pools, free (or less than $5) and entertaining if you go with a friend. Just be careful which basketball courts you go to. Some are pretty sketchy

5. Education, yeah there are stupid people but America also houses all of the world's best universities minus Oxford. Even UTexas is top 30 or 40 in the world and its seen as a sports oriented school in the US. 
It's more of a socioeconomic problem with weight and politics compared to an overall education issue. The average rich person tends to lean towards the Republicans because they support less taxing on the rich but more taxes on the poor and middle class. I also guarantee a lot of people are republicans because their dad was a republican. But this point is conceded to you, there is no cure for stupid

6. I admit it is easier to go to McDonalds and get a McChicken rather than actually cook so I can go home and relax. I still do it regularly, if there was one thing I would change about myself it would be the laziness, but I also have a slow cooker. I bought this thing on Black Friday for $30 instead of NBA 2k15 and I don't regret it at all. This thing can steam vegetables and cook rice and chicken at the same time. Check out some of those cheap eating websites, there are literally hundreds of them, for where to buy food. Usually I go to Costco or Walmart. Put food in slow cooker and watch TV for about 45 minutes and then eat

I'm seriously not joking.  We're going to experience mass layoffs in the next ten years as software and hardware lowers costs and raises efficiencies.  For instance, a huge sector of manufacturing is fast food jobs.  Chilis has already replaced the waiters with tablets.  Next will be food making.  McD's is testing order kiosks.  This means more unemployment and shortfalls on SSI, whatever.  And those increased profits and decreased costs get passed to the rich, not the poor.  Without a tax, we're going to have huge income inequality.

Oh thank god. People complaining here have no idea what they're talking about. If you had never been a waiter or had a job where you provided great service then honestly you have no idea what the hell you're talking about. From my years in the restaurant and service industry my opinion is tips are extremely important to small restaurant owners AND waiters. The job is damn hard! I don't know what the hell restaurant you're going to where the waiter is not doing more than just serving tables. I guarantee you waiters and servers do soooo much more in most restaurants. Especially in smaller restaurants.

Second, I feels so bad for people in mcdonalds and Taco Bell. I honestly feel these people deserve tips and always wish I could reward them for doing a job no one else wants to. Even if they have no choice. Some people to great jobs.

Third, many other services should be tipped more. Like house cleaning and Nannys.

This is the equivalent of the rich thinking they understand the poor class. You won't unless you've lived it.

Now that's a bunch of bullshit there. It's a false narrative that's commonly cited.

Fresh produce isn't expensive whatsoever. It's cheap as hell. I'm looking at a circular in front of me right now and you can get vegetables cheap. I'll even take a picture of it so you don't think I'm making it up:

[picture](http://www.imgur.com/TofY6KT)

You can get a whole rotisserie chicken for $5 that's already cooked for you, then add an entire bag potatoes and vegetables for a few bucks.

As you can see in my picture, you can go to the store right now and buy an entire 5 pound bag of potatoes for $1.49, and that will feed an entire family. Even if every single person in a large 5 person family ate an entire pound of potatoes (which is more than 2 full servings), that component only cost you $1.49. You could buy cabbage for 17 cents a pound. Broccoli is 99 cents a pound. And nobody eats an entire pound of cabbage. This will feed the entire family. 

So I hope you can see that making a meal with a rotisserie chicken, potatoes, and broccoli will only cost that family $7.50 and will feed 5 people, for a final total of $1.50 per person. 

And the narrative that fresh produce isn't available in poor areas is also false. I used to live in downtown philly and also a small towns in NJ and PA. There's always a store that sells this stuff, and it's usually cheaper than the Shop Rite ad I showed you. If you go to the Hispanic section they always have fresh produce because they usually cook. 

It's most mostly poor white people and black people who are lazy and don't cook. My family didn't cook, we ate pop tarts and soda, McDonald's, etc. The produce was available- my parents just didn't know how to cook. However my girlfriend's family always cooked, so now that I live with her we eat like this every night. And I should add that even though my family ate like this growing up, we were all skinny. People used to be more active and were thin even if they ate like crap. The obesity epidemic mostly started in the last 30 years.

I don't know what your field is like, but I wrote my entire dissertation while working a full time job 2,000 miles away from my graduate department; we just exchanged drafts by email/mail until I went back for my defense.

If you can get to the US you'd be in the same position as any other unemployed person, no? Qualified for food assistance and other benefits, though quite possibly homeless until you find work. No extended family? Maybe a Craigslist roommate situation would work out? I'd aim for a place with low unemployment and a climate that is amenable to being outdoors...find a cheap place to live, take an hourly job, and write the diss at night.

&gt; Libertarians say they're for social equality

Nope, we're not for social equality at all. We're for the efforts of an individual to match what he or she has created. If you create nothing then you receive nothing from a forced government run charity that uses force and coercion as it's primary tools. A person can give something to the poor because they want to but you can't put others at gun point and tell them to give to the poor.

Since we're not for social equality we hope to create a system where if you go to McDonalds or similar very low level place of employment you might foreseeably be better off than say if you elected to just take naps all day. The idea being that the individual is paramount. His or her rights are sacred &amp; that forced redistribution of wealth through programs like welfare (where the welfare recipient makes +/- something very close to the low level employee) actually cause society not to function correctly. 

&gt;Remove governmental recognition of marriage and then there's no gay marriage conflict.
This is a non-solution. A no answer. It's... dumb. Marriage exists.

Yes marriage is a function of the state because it's a function of the state. Brilliant argument. This can never be changed, it is truly unshakable. /s 

How can you (foreseeably since you're in this sub) hold the opinion that pot should be legalized but we'll always need a piece of paper from the government to remind us who the one person is that we're allowed to bang?

I mean come on, the logic there is just laughable. 

&gt;It's an economic system as far from the center as Communism, just in the other direction.

Your only comment I can 100% agree with... Libertarianism isn't even slightly collectivist. There is no forced taking of resources from one person to give them to another. There are no prohibited thoughts. There is no prohibited speech. There is no prohibited commerce..... wait tell me again how that's not a form of liberalism?

&gt;It's also a little pretentious to think that the government made drugs illegal to create a criminal class, and with absolutely NO regard for what drugs do, or seem to do

I'll give you that drugs were initially banned because we didn't want blacks and hispanics running around raping the white women (yes this was an actual concern). So there was a "legitimate" concern... do I think pot specifically has stayed illegal until 2015 under US federal law because the government is trying to do us all a favor?..... no, nope, not at all I think it's a massive business &amp; even though it doesn't work it does "create" a lot of jobs (for federal cronies). 

&gt;It's why the philosophy is so appealing, and I could go on and on, but the fact is by the time you've reached the ground with all that rhetoric and ideology it's a very different creature.

Let me just say that with everything you've written I hope it's immediately apparent to people that you are not a libertarian, you have very skewed views of libertarians (probably gained from having taking a poly-sci class which you believe makes you an expert - no need to read any of Rand's books - you took that poly-sci class).... or alternatively &amp; even worse you never read any of her books before making this comment, never took the ass backwards poly-sci class taught by somebody who hates us, and just decided that you'd base your opinions about us on the citizens of Idaho...

In any case I'd implore people to do additional research about what a libertarian is &amp; what they believe in instead of taking this user's word for it... if you don't it's like learning about the gays from a Southern Baptist preacher (probably not the best place to start).

&gt;there went any semblance of a good point there with a sea of bias.

Yeah, you've got some pretty strong bias here professor.

Branded with a title that is synonymous with the scorned individual in Judeo-Christian faiths, the fast food worker is looked upon as a parasite on society. The Devil is a part timer is meant to show that depite the hard working attitude of those in the lower class, they will be continuously looked down upon by society. This is especially evident when Maou's compatriot, also low-income, Emilia does everything in her power to remind him of his shortcomings and the poor choices he made in his past. 

Despite this Maou's dreams remain locked on the stars, his dream of world conquest is there to remind the viewer of a world ruled by the workers. 

In other words The Devil is a Part Timer is a love letter to Karl Marx and Marxian philosophy. The proletariat has been taught to despise her compatriots but Maou dreams of a world where the proletariat can be in charge. 

TLDR The devil is a part timer is written for commies.

There are homeless people everywhere.
This homeless guy asked me for money the other day.
I was about to give it to him and then I thought he was going to use it on drugs or alcohol.
And then I thought, that's what I'm going to use it on.
Why am I judging this poor bastard.
People love to judge homeless guys. Like if you give them money they're just going to waste it.
Well, he lives in a box, what do you want him to do? Save it up and buy a wall unit?
Take a little run to the store for a throw rug and a CD rack? He's homeless.
I walked behind this guy the other day. 
A homeless guy asked him for money.
He looks right at the homeless guy and says why don't you go get a job you bum.
People always say that to homeless guys like it is so easy.
This homeless guy was wearing his underwear outside his pants.
Outside his pants. I'm guessing his resume isn't all up to date.

There is bound to be abuse or even fraud in any system.

When it happens it is infuriating.  However anecdotal evidence isn't a statistic.  

The majority on assistance are hard working people using it temporarily to get out of a bad situation.  When they do, they start making more money, paying more taxes, and spending more money thus growing the economy.  

This is worth putting up with a percentage that abuse it.  And what is the alternative anyway?

Letting kids go hungry, people go homeless and or turn to crime?  I don't think we can realistically say that if everybody needed a job they would just up and get one.  Some of these people are working 2 or 3 already just to get by.

You tell me somebody getting a big tax refund and I'll tell you about a lady I knew that worked during the day as a fast food employee, at night loading laundry in a 100+ degree facility being paid under the table below minimum wage all so she could feed her daughter and pay rent after leaving the wealthy but physically abusive father.

That woman would never have left the guy and might not be alive if it wasn't for the piddly assistance she received by the state.  She cleaned houses on her time off too, I don't even know when she slept.  

I know that isn't as easily shared as "lazy people" but it has merit

I suspect that hedge fund managers making 50 mil a year paying 15% capital gains tax while a middle class guy pays 28% tax donates to super pacs that hires lobbyists to further this type of idea.  

We've got a ton of fucked up shit that happens with politics, we should focus on that before we start fucking over poor people because it makes us feel better to look down on them.  Who knows you could be in a bad situation one day and might need it.

We are all a medical emergency away from total financial meltdown.  I for one want to live in a country where we help the least of us at least half as often as we help the best of us.

&gt; Doesn't make them great, makes them accessible, not great. Ate at Momofuku when it was unknown, I was like, meh. Pickles were good.

It's mid-range ramen at like $15 a bowl in Manhattan. I admit I've eaten at better but there's more to a great chef than being the best cook. I've never been able to afford Momofuku Ko, David Chang's haute cuisine dining place, but from friends that have gone, it's legit.

I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've eaten from Roy Choi.

&gt; This trend of eschewing techniques for exoticism has to stop somewhere. There's techniques, which takes years to earn and perfect, and there's different. They're both good, but for different reasons. 

Wait, I don't understand your argument. Are you saying there's no technique or hard won skill in making great ramen or tacos? Cause I heard a similar argument before on reddit about a guy dismissing [Jiro Ono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Ono_%28chef%29) because he "just makes sushi". That's like saying [Domenico DeMarco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Fara_Pizza) hasn't spent years perfecting his craft because it's "just pizza"

&gt; Which is more durable?

Well if you're saying what I think you're saying, ramen, pizza, sushi, and tacos have been around for a long ass time.

Also, how are you gonna look at Roy Choi doing something like [Loco'l](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/loco-l-revolutionary-fast-food) and not call him a great chef? He's making cheap, accessible, delicious fast food that is genuinely good for you. You can get a completely FDA-approved, great for your health item for 99 cents. Roy Choi is directly attacking the vicious cycle between [obesity and poverty](http://frac.org/initiatives/hunger-and-obesity/are-low-income-people-at-greater-risk-for-overweight-or-obesity/) by trying to create a fast food joint that's quick, delicious, and won't give you a heart attack.

Even if the venture totally fails, how many chefs out there are doing something like this and pouring their time, money, and effort into making a practical change instead of big clumsy government projects? Promoting awareness doesn't work when the people hurting most from obesity don't have access to clean, convenient food in the first place.

But beyond those things, Roy Choi and David Chang are inventive. They're pushing food forward and they've done a lot to smash down the discrimination against ethnic foods. When I was in elementary school, kids used to make fun of me for bringing dried seaweed for lunch. Now those same knuckleheads are probably buying overpriced dried seaweed at Whole Foods, all because Roy and David both said, "Fuck you, this shit is delicious."

Now that I see your view on them, I think chin ups 1 day, dips 2nd day and repeat would work pretty well.

Would the calorie deficit affect how much I am gaining in muscle mass (I heard it does(edit just saw it does after a 0.7% weight loss a week ))? That is what I mainly want, I am fine with cutting after, but I heard most beginners can do both (Gain muscles, lose weight) in the beginning.

Edit1: I found the thing I was talking about, so should I even bother eating less or would the running and lifting be enough if a deficit in calories to promote the weight loss with muscle gain?

<FALSE>
--------------

can I lose fat and build muscle at the same time?
The ability to gain muscle while losing fat is dependent on the relationship between your fatness and muscularity. An overly-fat and under-trained person will be able to achieve simultaneous fat loss and muscle gain. A very lean person near his/her limit for muscle growth will not. As one moves away from the overly-fat, under-trained status towards a leaner, more muscular body this ability is diminished. At some point, the vast majority of people will see better/quicker results by choosing to do one or the other (gain muscle, lose fat - often referred to as 'bulking' and 'cutting', respectively) at a time. For a highly general rule of thumb: if you have been training effectively for a year or more, you're better off with a bulk/cut cycle. See Lyle McDonald's Adding Muscle While Losing Fat - Q&amp;A for more discussion.

A 2011 paper suggests a weekly rate of body-weight loss of 0.7% can permit muscle gain in both men and women while losing fat mass. Women were also able to increase muscle while losing fat at a weekly rate of body-weight loss of 1.0-1.4%. Men, however, lost muscle mass at this increased rate.

In real terms, 0.7% body-weight loss was achieved via a daily deficit of 3.2 calories per lb of total bodyweight (or 7 calories per kg of total bodyweight). At this rate, your goal calorie intake = TDEE - [BWlb x 3.2kcal] (or TDEE - [BWkg x 7kcal]). This is a good place to start. The 1.0-1.4% range works out to a daily deficit of 4.5-6.4 calories per lb of total bodyweight (or 10-14 calories per kg of total bodyweight).

Congratulations, you've invented communism. 

But really, the issue I have with this logic is that it's not really a conflict. The argument goes like this "If everyone stole, then no one would own anything, so stealing would be impossible" which willing to acknowledge that a universal maxim will reshape society, but that the maxim should be judged on the previous, no longer applicable rules of society. 

Kant basically says it's immoral to work at McDonalds. See: I am lazy, so I will only get a minimum wage fast food job. Everyone does this, now there are no rich people who can own franchises and no McDonald's corporation. We want a world were be both have jobs and employers and they are mutually exclusive. Exact same logic as the bank robbing example. 

There *have* to better examples demonstrating Kantian ethics.

&gt;The people in my community just want to live our lives in peace, without worrying about getting shot or robbed.

Or getting kicked out of their apartments by landlords? I'm sure the other things you've mentioned apply to the vast majority of residents wherever you go, whatever the race. Further, I can assure you that, wherever you lived, you were near multiple people who didn't just go to one job, but to two or three. I can assure you that they had dinner with their families (McDonalds or otherwise) and made or got extra for someone who needed it, regularly. I can assure you that, without access to expensive tax professionals, they paid a higher percentage of taxes out of their meager wages than you. 

All these things that you think make you better, don't really, because they're common. So, too, is the ugliness: weren't blacks met with the same disrespect and lawlessness during their first efforts at integration, mere decades ago? There was more than spitting and mugging; there were bombings, and arson, and beatings. It was wrong then as it is wrong now, but this outrage, as if your experience was uniquely horrifying, is inconsiderate.

Here's my theory: we're not as different as you want to believe we are. Our differences are superficial, similar values projected through prisms of relative historical and personal experience. So, "We're not the same," is not a valid excuse for this double standard of culpability. If your goal is to suggest that responsibility for introspection and corrective action for society's ills be defined along racial delineations - really, class delineations, and not something I fully disagree with - please don't stop at pointing fingers outward.

Have you read enough of these comments yet to realize teaching isn't valued? I'm bailing on teaching after 10 years because this is how the majority views it. The idea that it's like "any other job" is insane, but it's the way people think about it. Unfortunately, you're now going to get teachers who treat it like "any other job." Like most issues in America, the wealthy trick the morons into voting against their own interests. Gutting the public schools doesn't mean shit to them (just like gutting social security, welfare, or the health care system doesn't mean shit to rich people), because they can afford to operate outside the system. Joe Six-pack wanted to save a few dollars on taxes, and he did it by trading away our best and brightest educators for a cookie-cutter, McDonalds-style system that will serve our children's educational needs as well as the aforementioned chain has served their nutritional needs. Short-sighted jackasses.

&gt; Actually, a capitalist economy depends on a slave class in order to function

Firstly, it's pretty insulting to even imply that our current society is in any way analogous to slavery.  I think it displays a pretty gross underappreciation for what slavery was.  

But that aside, how do you figure?  The rich do not need "cheap, disposable" goods.  They're rich.  The super rich don't need McDonald's.  They don't need cheap phones.  They don't need cheap anything.  

You're throwing around words like slavery and exploitation, but there's nothing here to back up these claims.  Why do the rich require someone to be poor?  How does capitalism depend on a group of people being poor?

Capitalism is nothing more than a system where people decide for themselves what certain goods and services are worth.  How does that require people to be poor?

&gt; . If she did want to help the homeless she should have donated to one of the many homeless shelters, 

its rarely so easy.  Have you ever talked to homeless people who can't get into a shelter?

I bought a girl who was about 25 some McDonalds and talked to her - because fuckit I had an hour to kill while waiting for my train (and she reminded me of a friend of mine who is recovering from being homeless).  Talked to her to understand her situation.

She got kicked out of her house by her dad - her only living relative.  He has her ID/birth certificate/etc.  She can't get in contact with him.  She needs that identification in order to get welfare - IE get into a shelter.

Maybe she's full of shit, but, it honestly doesn't sound like an impossible scenario.

yeah, she's probably a drug addict, but, yknow what, plenty of people have done plenty worse.  She's still a human.

Other homeless people talk about how shelters aren't that much better than being outside on  the streets.

“The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little.”  ― Banksy

Comic book artists are often exploring ideas and such without such a commercial interest.

As for the "hidden inner" Love: It's a complex topic. But it's entirely true.  LSD drugs, car accidents ("near death"), brain surgery - reveals this.  It's only been a short period of time in the past 1500 years that people have had the freedom to date, go to movies, etc.  Most people were strangers and got married - mostly socially arranged (family, geographic circumstances, class systems, etc).

In fact, what Wells said to Barry about Love and the subconscious was directly on this same theme.  I would suggest the writers know the teaching of Joseph Campbell ( who inspired Star Wars ) and his ideas on the Troubadours year 1210 significance.

Quoting from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2k3ag8/everyone_in_america_would_be_better_off_if_we/clhkzq8):

Because people never actually tackled progressive taxation, they never adequately explain why progressive taxation is important. Please allow me:

Firstly, it's important to note that money is nothing more than a symbol, an idea. It might sound strange, but one dollar is not worth one dollar - that dollar bill you're holding is nothing more than a piece of paper, virtually worthless. It only has worth because we, as a people, give it worth. We say that that piece of paper is worth one "dollar", a universal unit in trade, to save us the hassle of bartering. The important part being, that piece of paper is nothing, other than what we as a society decide it will be, for the benefit of our society. That's how money works.

Secondly, and I know this sounds like double-speak, but one dollar does not equal a hundred cents. Mathematically, it absolutely is, but effectively, it couldn't be farther from the truth. Walk into a dollar store with a penny and try to buy 1/100th of a candy bar. Go into McDonald's with a dime and try to get 1/10th of one of their dollar menu items.

Basically, the less money you have, the less effectively you can use it, and this scales all the way up. If you make enough money to afford a car, you don't have to go to the shitty grocery store across the street, and can head to one with better prices that's out of walking distance. If you make more, you might be able to afford a Costco membership, and buy your groceries in bulk sizes, which is a lot cheaper. And maybe you can trade in that shitty used car that was all you could afford before for something that gets more MPG and doesn't require costly repairs every six months. And instead of buying a cheap pair of sneakers you'll have to replace in a half a year, you might be able to buy yourself a decent pair of shoes that'll last you a few years. In many cases, you end up paying less in the long-run by paying more in the short-run.

So having more money means you can use it more effectively, giving you more bang for your buck. But it also gives you more opportunity, and not just opportunity to lead a better life, but more opportunity for upward-mobility.

Think of the costs associated with getting a job. To work in fast food, you presumably need some clean clothes, maybe a bus pass. To be able to shop around for a better employer, you'll need decent, reliable transportation. To get a better job, you might need better clothes, a cell phone, a computer with an internet connection... and moving up the scale, you need a college education... and for that, you're looking at tuition, books, and the costs associated with spending the amount of time it takes to get through college without a well-paying job.

If you can barely afford the clothes on your back, you'll be lucky to be earning minimum wage... and maybe after a few years of scrimping and saving, you'll be able to get a car, and have some slightly better options. If you have a decent income, you have a much better opportunity to get a college degree in a high-paying field, or work your way up the corporate ladder.

That's not even getting into the facets of your life that indirectly affect your job opportunities. If you're wealthier, you have better legal options, which means that you're less likely to be convicted or spend time in prison, even for committing the exact same crime as a poor person. You have better medical coverage, which means less time spent having to call in sick to work, and being more fit also makes you a more appealing job candidate. There are even some ties between level of income and access to a nutritional diet - low-income folks generally eat shittier food because they can't afford to buy healthier food.

This isn't a fluke. It's how money works - the more of it there is, the more powerful a force it is, even proportionally, and the easier it is to get more of it.

However, there's another side to this too. The more money you have, the more expendable any portion of it becomes, even proportionally-speaking. Let's look at three guys, Allen, Billy, and Charlie. Allen makes $20K a year, Bill makes $200K a year, and Charlie makes $2 Million a year. Each is taxed at 10% of their income... but as need to happen sometimes, the taxes need to go up. Let's say they double, so it's 20% now - the same for all three, right? Hell, it's harder on the richer, because they're paying more money than the poor guy! But in actuality, it's the poor guy who's sacrificing the most because of this, because so little of his income is expendable. Now Allen needs to decide between paying the rent and paying for food. Bill needs to hold off on that family vacation to Europe he's been planning. And Charlie... well, Charlie will gripe about the number in his bank account being less than he'd like, and then he'll go and buy his twelfth Ferrari anyway.

Remember how I said "money only has worth because we, as a people, give it worth, for the benefit of our society". That money you supposedly "own" isn't even really property, it's an idea used to facilitate the operation of a healthy society, and it does so by making an easy, simple conversion of property into a common exchange value. But since its very nature is uneven and broken, it needs to be addressed as such. And since a 10% tax hike on someone earning $20K is not the same as a 10% tax hike on someone earning $2 Million, for the many reasons I've just stated, we have progressive taxation, where the wealthier you are, the greater a portion of your income you contribute in taxes.

To take this to an extreme, if there was an across-the-board tax of 50%, with wages in America what they are now, the wealthy would still be living comfortably, the middle class would be scraping by... and the poor would starve to death. Treating everyone the same is not fair.

Republicans and those aligned with them like to paint this in a way that's essentially "ganging up on the rich people", "punishing" them for "success". However, if you treat everyone the same, make everyone pay a flat tax rate, then you are punishing the poor, who are less able to afford it. And it's easy to point at the numbers and turn them into a picture that shows the terrible burden the wealthy have to pay thanks to progressive taxation... but the truth of it is, the reality those numbers translate into is one where the wealthy can afford to contribute more, without any noticeable change to their lifestyle, and it's not just because they have more to give, it's because the fact that they have more makes them less dependent on it, better-able to acquire more of it, and less affected by its loss (again, even by proportion).

That is why any reasonable capitalist society taxes the rich progressively more than the poor. It's not to "punish" anyone for success, it's because the nature of money makes it far more invaluable by proportion to the poor than it is to the rich.
