I'm against marijuana legalization because I want to keep blacks and hispanics in prison. I also don't want student loan reform because minorities should be stuck paying for choosing terrible for profit scam schools. Minorities make terrible choices and they should have consequences instead of everyone else picking up the bill.

I hate that I agree with that obnoxiously racist cartoon but hip hop before it went all 'gangster' was actually somewhat socially positive and told young black kids to go to school and get a job and stay off drugs because it kept them out of jail.

Pretty much all pop music since the inception of the recording industry has ripped off black artists to resell their music to white consumers.

Something like 76% of all hip hop is bought by white consumers who have more expendable cash than black folk, who are mostly poor and live in urban communities.

Anyways, when hip hop started getting bigger around 1988-89 the major labels started taking notice and signing artists from the underground and the music started taking on a different attitude that went from criticizing the ghetto to glorifying the ghetto lifestyle. 

Rick Rubin, Jerry Heller, Jimmy Iovine, David Geffen, and others made a shitload of money off black people buying into the gangsta image.

Hell, Jimmy Iovine stands to make as much off Apple as Dr Dre who is making a billion dollars selling his name to those shitty headphones.

And meanwhile, black on black crime is still fairly high, high school drop out rates are still high, and so are arrest rates &amp; prison stats.

I wouldn't blame 'the Jews' for all that, it's mostly corporate labels but there was a bunch of Jewish guys that did make a lot of money selling gangster rap to the masses.

TL;DR at bottom

Erm alright, basically Castro took over(of course) and a few years passed and people started getting agitated with Castro(For some it was quicker then others) for taking land and other things to "distribute wealth" or something. 

Anyways, he tried to stage a revolution against Castro, somebody snitched on him, he was even caught with weapons I believe as well, that or he threw them in the canal shortly beforehand. 

So he got arrested and had the same name as somebody else. Well lucky for him, he was released as they thought he was another guy, he tried to go flee immediately (Government is trying to kill you, no time for goodbyes). He tried to go to the American Embassy but they knew what he tried to do so they rejected him, he went to the Brazilian Embassy, got accepted, was homeless for a while, got a family and I assume the family is doing well/hope but he might be dead by now.

Sorry for the delayed delivery. 

TL;DR Great Uncle tried to revolt against Castro in early/mid 60's, got snitched on, may have been caught with guns or they were disposed of slightly before, imprisoned and was to be executed, had same name as somebody else and was released, rejected from American Embassy for attempting to incite revolt or w/e, ended up going to Brazil, was homeless for a bit, got a family, hope they're well off

The problem is you just don't know everyone's situation.

A woman living in a homeless shelter, whose already attempted suicide twice in the last 6 months, she might not be mentally stable enough to get through it.

Now if she wants to try , we let her try , but we also shouldn't force her to have a kid she might not be able to care for.


And the foster homes are overflowing, these poor kids are on a one way street to poverty / prison , very few kids who just age out of the system do well.

Plus the pro life party is also the no healthcare for poor expectant mothers party.

Yes, it was a comedy sketch. The point of the sketch was to show that people are unphased by illegal Government surveillance, unless their "dick pics" are involved, then they become outraged. That the comedy of the situation. 

That's just ridiculous, you know full well China censors their media and jails reporters.

I can't argue with that, but free speech is still a major part of a free society, something that China lacks. You can't have change without it.

Americans have left-wing parties, but the majority of the people just don't want them, that's part of Democracy. Don't get me started on money in politics, it's the same everywhere. Many Chinese politicians are Billionaires, and their level of corruption would never get past an ethics committee in the US.

It's a shame that Chinese people think they are better off with a fake Democracy where you can only vote on one party, and allow their Government to control their freedom of expression. I would say you are deliberately miseducated as well, except I don't buy the Government bullshit, you seem to eat it up.

* Eric Garner resisted arrest for 15 minutes verbally before anything ever got physical.  He had an arm around his neck for a total of 8 seconds, which was released once they got him on the ground

* There is zero evidence of any wrong doing in the handling of the Michael Brown case.  The DOJ didn't find a singe pointing to any wrong doing surrounding that case.  In fact the only thing they found at all was some e-mails by two cops in an unrelated case.  That and black people are arrested and ticketed more than white people in the area.  But no evidence of any arrest or ticket being without merit.

* Black people are 6x more likely to be on welfare, and 6x more likely to go to prison.  If you agree poverty levels and crime levels are going to coincide then this is pretty strong evidence that the police force isn't racist but responding to an expected crime rate.

* In the Garner case a grand jury watched the entire video and saw all the evidence and testimony.  You saw a sensationalized agenda driven version by the media but clearly the every day citizens in the Grand Jury were just racist jerks bound to protect cops and stuff. 

* The kid with the gun, a sad story, Kid made a fake gun look real as fuck and was going around pointing it at people.  Cops arrived and went up on the kid too quick, but clearly feared for their lives as they ran falling down away from the kid when he pulled the gun.  Tragic accident but nothing criminal happened.

* as for the walmart case, I do not have the specifics but once again a jury of every day citizens saw all the evidence and decided to not indict.  Is your claim that the jury is all racist cop lovers too?

* as for cops not going to jail when "real crimes are committed" the end of my post is just a few month sample of cops going to prison for "real crimes

* Just because more of you die doesn't mean your lives are in danger more often.  And if you were trying to get someone to leave and they accidently died, no you would likely not be going to prison.

Here are two cases of bouncers who killed people while escorting them out and they did not go to prison, hell one of them sat on a guy killing him to "teach him a lesson" and yet no prison time

* Cops get the benefit of the doubt when people do not co-operate with them.  This is because a cop does not know if the person is carrying a weapon, if they are facing the death penalty from other charges etc etc.  If you do not cooperate with a cop they have a reasonable fear for their own safety.  IF you do cooperate with the cops and they abuse you, the law will come down hard on them for this.


* Here is evidence of cops "not getting away with it, mind you it is just a few month sample

&gt;I don't think pointing out that someone "looks rasta" is automatically a negative remark

I get that. I wasn't trying to explain why *you* might think it strange to point something like that out, but rather why *others*, who see people like that on a daily basis might experience it differently. They might personally know people who look like that and be aware that none of those are actually Rastafarians at all. If that's the case, then they might justifiably regard your comment as stereotyping, which is at the very least unpleasant.

I wasn't there. I don't know what they understood/experienced when you spoke. I *do* know that it would be extremely presumptuous for either of us to attach too much significance to a single personal experience, just as it would be presumptuous to attach too much meaning to a single weird and unpleasant encounter with a group of women or black people.  

Regarding your edit, you may not be aware of this, but many white Christian people don't even fully respect free speech and (to a lesser degree) secularism. Leaders aren't going to tell *them* to fuck off. Anyway, I'm Belgian and read a number of opinion pieces on the main news website, written by highly educated Christians (including a lawyer and a Christian philosopher) who were adamant that they were not Charlie. You can't disparage faith in their opinion. Regardless, European leaders (heads of state) have absolutely (!) already done what you say you want them to do. The only difference is that they haven't said that people should self-deport otherwise. I agree with excluding that part. It serves very little purpose beyond just being aggressive and polarizing. If the extremist or very conservative Muslims would actually comply, then it would be a bad thing for people elsewhere. It would just mean exporting the problem. If you only care about your own country, that's fine, but if you care about people elsewhere, then you can't let your crazies go off to places like Syria and cause more problems over there. Violent extremists have to be jailed. Non-violent extremists need to be engaged, especially by moderate Muslims who have the best chance of getting through to them.

Lastly, multiculturalism is a fact in most of Europe. The issue isn't that you're only allowed to "glorify" it. The issue is that arguing against it is a mark of stupidity at this point. A couple decades ago it would have been a mark of racism. I almost feel like you're equating acceptance of difference with surrender of the best Western values. That's a narrative that people like Pat Condell push all the time. It's a narrative that is problematic. The only way to address genuine issues of culture and ethnicity without being seen as racist or otherwise bigoted is to speak very carefully about it. Some politicians would rather just not talk about it at all. You can't get burnt if you never do the cooking. Taboos like this are a natural byproduct of decency. I'm not as offended by it as some others choose to be. It's not perfect, but the alternative isn't either and we don't live in a fantasy world where everyone is brave, well-informed and wise.

Mouth breathing assholes man. I spent some time with the grade under me - probably five/six years ago. I loved our teacher - dude was an eccentric, well spoken, knowledgable individual. He could rant about obscure shit and make you think about weird shit, in a good way.

But the class i was with was absolutely shitty and disrespectful. Everyone slept all class. Never seemed to be prepared and most of all acted shocked to find out that he expected them to have their work done. 

They even spoke the same way as this young lady did. They had that really slow demeanor to 'em. The voice was like mud or molasses. All their words seem to seep out at zero miles an hour.

And not a single one of them managed to become anything worth noting. Young single parents and drunks the lot of them.

Seen a few of them walking on the street yesterday. Faces red with vodka breath. Dead end living. The whole lot of 'em had kids young as if that'd be a suitable substitute for a real, concrete, sociological, spiritual purpose. They are the ones lining our system's jails and schools up with more and more brain dead assholes.

They feed our systems and contribute nothing. Aspiration and inspiration seem to escape them at every turn.

I'd also like to note that i come from a lower class background.

The people who enslaved him didn't do so legally. The importation of slaves from foreign countries had been illegal for quite some time when the movie takes place, so some slavers made money by capturing freed blacks and selling them into slavery. 

Educating slaves was uncommon and often illegal. If the main character was able to prove who he actually was, it would expose the men who enslaved them to criminal charges and prison time. To avoid this, they would kill him. That's why he had to keep quiet about it. 

Remember, too, that he wasn't owned by the plantation owner. He was bought on credit, and the overseer acts as an agent of the mortgage holder. He, too, has an interest in making sure the story doesn't get out.

Let me guess.

None of you upstanding individuals have the balls to drive up there and dish out some real, public sourced justice on the police department, city hall, and whoever the fuck else has claimed "authority" in that region, right?

No?  Just going to sit around on your ass, bitch about on the internet, then go back to your shitty lives pretending to be happy so you aren't outcast as the "negative nancy doom and gloom" in the office, right?

You people disgust me.  Oh, there's a lawful process, you say?  The lawful process that is disproportionately harder for poor citizens to utilize?  That's the one you're talking about?

No, see, there's another process.  First, you verify this news story.  Is it true?  Yes?

Then you walk into the police department, put a gun to the head of the police chief, and tell him he's finished.  He is to resign.  He loses his pension.  He will serve jail time.  He will never hold another public job.  Every officer in the department suffers the same fate.

Then you go to City Hall or whatever entity has authority of the police station, and every single employee (in a position of authority) also receives the same treatment.

Is this some tribal group?  And which Canadian government office granted them sovereign control of their land?  They will be punished as well.

Or, do nothing.  Sit on your ass why their buddy judge manipulates everything so everybody keeps a job, a pension, and once again, the poor people get fucked.

Of course, this happened back in 2011.  So clearly, nobody did anything about it.

Bunch of slaves, you are.  And the individuals here who are affluent enough to engage bad governments, but don't?  You are the worst.  The middle class, the upper class.  You apathetic assholes.

Shfinô /ʃfɪno/ is a Pwrina miner who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the year 1281MA He was visiting Lem Pars, the island inhabited by the Lemne, to buy a rare breed of livestock of fine quality which his old shepherd father sorely wanted to graze in the upland *Pwrdda* (adjective of 'Pwr') hills. But while he was there a Lemne rebel called Corocoga had been raiding Imperial outposts and colonist settlements with a small army of men as part of a stand against the Antagan Empire's rule over the island. In return the Empire sent out a small force of imperial soldiers to show some force on the island. The imperial soldiers did some light raiding and captured prisoners, they captured anyone who had the misfortune of simply being there, including Shfinô. Shfinô tried to tell the soldiers that he was Pwrina and not Lemne but they didn't care a wind's breath about it. The imperial forces loaded the prisoners into a ship and chained them below deck and sailed far, far away from Malomanan. During the long journey on the sea Shfinô tried to speak to the other prisoners but the Lemre language was unintelligible to Pwr, though his words caught the attention of another Pwrina named Rôfofi /rofɔfɪ/who also got captured by the imperial soldiers. The two formed a quick alliance as they both shared a homeland. The ship sailed all the way to the City of Antagan itself, the heart of the Empire in the continent of Henda. When Shfirô was lead out of the ship a whole new world met his eyes. The sun shine bright and hot, too hot for his pale skin. The city roared with the sounds of a bustling day, the buildings rose high and were numerous in number, this city was *huge* in the eyes of a Pwrina whose homeland is wet, cold and rainy. He and Rôfofi were then loaded into a large wooden wagon which transported them to the outskirts of the city which still lay within the walls though far away from any home or building. They were being led to the Antagan silver mines, whose silver pays the massive army and fills the rich man's pocket among other things. Good enough for the Empire, though very unfortunate for Shfirô as they were mined by slave miners which were obtained by capturing people from foreign lands. See, the Empire didn't care if Shfirô was Lemne or Pwrina, all they knew was that he could work and make them some money and he by chance happened to be a miner himself. He was quickly put  to work with slaves captured from around the world, he toiled next to Wasgar prisoners-of-war, next to Lemne rebels, next to Tokaḳ nomads, next to Venicones poachers and also Antagan criminals. But what struck him most was the woman and children down in the mines, as for generations slaves have been out to work in the mines, some of these people were born into slavery and have known nothing else but the master's lash. Shfirô was now among the lowest class of people in the 'glorious' Antagan Empire. Shfirô showed Rôfofi how to swing a pick to avoid the punishment of the overseer who gave any slackers a seeing to. For years he and Rôfofi lived as slaves and managed to pick up the Tåns language and became a part of the slave miners subculture. Understandably the slaves weren't too happy about their situation and decided to fight for their freedom. Before they left the mines and headed for the city they had to get rid of the mine's overseers. Shfirô snuck up behind one and swung the point of his pick right between the overseer's neck and shoulder, killing him. Once all the overseers were taken care of the slaves marched into the centre of the city and made some noise which the imperial ears weren't happy to hear. They shouted demands of freedom, to be let go to return to their homelands. But their shouts were answered with cold steel. The miners only had their picks to fight back with but regardless they caused a massive riot in what would be known as the infamous *Håkyrlīnša nar Gīrarajys 1286ū* (in the Tåns language meaning "Miner's revolt of 1286"). Shfirô managed to kill a soldier and steal his sword and escaped the city while the chaos ensued. Rôfofi wasn't so lucky and like many others he died in the revolt. Shfirô tried to get on a boat back home but was quick to avoid any ships flying blue sails, as blue is the colour of the Antagan Empire which was hunting down any miners that escaped. He managed to get passage on a Wasgar boat which was on its way to the Moicha city of *Ỳrjému*, from there Shfirô got on another boat which went to Terchne territory and from there he walked a long journey to his Pwrdda home which he hadn't seen in 5 long years. He found his father's shieling and was reunited with his family. When his father first saw him his first words to his son were *yw lofàfiw sàwa, gŵara mw?* (you forgot the livestock, didn't you?).

My Lg G2 stock ROM offers the option to change certain animations.. And as far as themes and icons and stuff go, even though most of it can only be achieved through using a launcher, it is still a level of customisation that IOS doesn't have (at least without jailbreak). If you go over to /r/android and search for 'home screen' you'll see just how different peoples screens look just through the use of launchers.. Whether or not these customisations are good things or not is very subjective, but they're still available and can be ignored entirely.

I believe God wants to make you feel His love far more than we want it for ourselves.  

But... for mysteries that I cannot explain, He sometimes holds back.  

Rest assured, if you keep pursuing God, you WILL find Him.  But how to pursue the Hound of Heaven?

Take inventory of your life.  Are there sins that you currently engage in, that you need to repent of?  Sin + Holiness = Oil + Water.  God wants to see you take steps towards amending your life.  Christ calls us to repentance.

Are you taking steps to place God over all things in your life, even if it hurts?  Are you committed, as best as you are able, to put Him and His will over your own plans, your own desires, your own failings, your own victories?  This is a hard one; nobody wants to let go.  "Lord I believe, help my unbelief" is a proper response. [Heart]

Are you committed to going to a church, and talking with a pastor?  If that church has Sacraments, are you committed to taking steps towards reception of them?  Towards understanding the basis for their existence? [Soul]

Do you have a Bible?  Great.  Do you have a dedicated plan to read and understand it, in light of what your church believes?  Do you have a good devotional, or a good study guide?  Can you join a committed Bible Study group to help unpack some of the tough questions? [Mind]

Lastly, do you have a means to express your love of God through service?  Do you have access to a way to help serve the less fortunate in your vicinity, whether it be soup kitchens, homeless shelter, and prison ministry?  If you are unable to do so for the time being, could you consider tithing/donating 10% of your income to those volunteer organizations that help others? [Strength + Love Neighbor as Self]

Take these steps.  I believe God will honor a pure heart who actively pursues Him in this manner.

A company I used to work for filed for bankruptcy some years ago. It was just a normal bankruptcy for awhile, until somehow it was revealed that the company "cooked the books" the year prior to the bankruptcy in order to make things look more profitable (they were trying to entice investors to put money into the company).

Essentially, what happened is the state Attorney General brought suit against both the higher-level executives who made this decision, and the lower-level workers who manipulated the actual numbers. Most of the lower-level employees took plea deals (parole, community service, etc... I don't think any went to jail), and agreed to testify against the higher ups.

But anyway, you want to stay as far away from these things as you can. You can definitely be charged with a crime, and taking actions based on the instructions of your employer is no defense.

It's not just black men. It's black urban men between 16 and 64, who make up 2% of the nations population but commit something like 47% of its murders and make up a sizable amount of its prisoners.

Your point is one made often, but it entirely misses my point. This problem cannot be dealt with by firing police officers after they commit some stupid, often racist act. This problem can only really be dealt with retraining the entire police force. These problems are endemic and rather entwined with local prejudices (Mexicans, Blacks, Natives, etc.). Until it is accepted that the wide forces of prejudice are still felt and should still be fought, these problems will keep occurring. The aim is not to not exchange the disproportionate amount of black people in prison with white police officers, it is to balance race relations in the country

Stop using that piss poor talking point if you don't even understand the context.  That is because we actually enforce our laws.  We actually have the money and time to enforce our laws.  The top ten countries by population are China, India, US, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, and Japan.  So that is the only countries that are in the same league with us for this conversation about prison population.  Let's tackle your two examples. 

First N. Korea's are poorer than our poorest blacks and suffer more daily degradation than blacks in America and we do not have reliable figures on the incarcerated population I think you could make a pretty good argument that the entire country is a prison.  Also if N. Korea had more money they would most likely lock up more of there people.  You are free to go there and see how it works out for you though.

Now onto China your second example again we do not have reliable stats on prison in China.  First there is rampant corruption so laws at some points don't exist based on wealth or if you are related to the correct official.  Are you rich or related to a communist party official?Then like any totalitarian state there is a good chance there are mass graves still in use today.  Remember when the USSR collapsed and boom we found out where all those disappeared people went.  With a billion people a 25 cent bullet and a self dug grave solves many problem in a totalitarian regime no need for a prison population.  Though if you think you can hack it there head west until you end up in the east.

Now about the other eight countries on the list that are even close to America's population do you see any that ring out as winners for human rights and a fair judicial system?  I guess the two top are Russia and Japan for your best shot at first world standards like running water and reliable electricity.  If you are a straight white man Russia might be your ticket just don't think about going against the political line and be ready really hard times economically.  So that leaves Japan which is so homogenous that they don't fucking want you.  Being so insular culturally and rejection of drugs is often attributed to there low crime rate and of course there willingness to juke crime stats to save face.  You are more of an outcast in Japan than a black man at a Klan rally in Mississippi no matter who you are when you go to Japan.

So I really look forward to you actually thinking because I can sense you want to but you will not be doing that until you stop regurgitating talking points cooked up so you don't have to think.

What things do they want cut then? We know welfare and social security, education, healthcare.

It seems like the only thing the right wants government to do is protect property, jail blacks, and kill brown folks.

In Shadowrun, certain areas have much stricter enforcement than others.  If you're in the slums, you can probably get away with murder.  If you so much as brandish a pistol in the rich neighborhood, cops might be moments away.

Characters are by default outside of the system, and don't officially exist.  Getting caught is very very bad, since they basically have no rights.

Now my Shadowrun games tend to err towards the harsher side of things (black trenchcoat), and some people will dial down the consequences, but in the setting as written, messing with the wrong (rich) people will get you a death sentence (without a trial).

Now in d20 modern, back when I played it, we toned things down, since characters in that setting actually have rights, but you still didn't want to get caught doing anything very bad.

Honestly, you don't need to pass out a legal code (unless one of them is actually playing a lawyer), just use common sense.  Don't jump on them for jaywalking, just the big prison getting crimes (assault, murder, theft, arson, etc).

As for severity, how cautious do you want them to be.  If getting caught has dire consequences, a lot of the game shifts to detailed planning.  If you want a more seat-of-your pants game, lessen the consequences.  Just make sure the players know where they stand.

As deindustrialization, stagnant wages, the decline of workers rights, and wealth inequality have increased/gotten worse state and capital both are looking for ways to both keep people employed and also to deal with the consequences of the social dysfunction that comes from both problems. 

Private prisons are seen as a solution. We live in a world where the logic of neoliberal capitalism is taken as gospel. Obviously, the power structure as is has no intention whatsoever of providing for human needs that could constructively deal with the problems underlying criminality or allowing the existence of alternate grassroots economic structures that could replace the modern capitalist hierarchy and provide meaningful employment (think local co-ops or agricultural collectives, rather then huge industry)

Big business and government are symbiotic and always have been, let's never forget this. The government is in large part a creation of capital and capital can only retain it's privilege with the assistance of the government. 

With that in mind, prisons have filled a gap: They're seen as providing jobs for people in rural or job starved areas, they increase profits for corporations (what a politician could consider a benefactor in more ways then one), and they allow the state to clamp down on anything deemed as anti-social or destructive to the functioning of the system. 

This might sound conspiratorial, and to be sure no single person involved in all of this is really aware of all the implications and they all have their own motives. But it's a combination of all these things that paints the above picture. 

Basically, inequalities and ruptures in our society have gotten worse. The state is responding, not by fixing these issues, but by funneling people into the hands of private corporations. 

This is the end result of the dysfunctional and unsustainable power structure created by capitalism. It's dropped it's pretensions about human liberty or progress and has gone in the total opposite direction in order to deal with problems it itself created. The state, lapdog that it is, is going along obediently. 

Frankly, there's no real reforming our way out of this. It's either we ditch the gigantic and inherently unequal and destructive capitalism that we've sworn ourselves to, as well as the state, or things like this continue to happen. 

Nothing is a bigger wall between human beings and the things they need to survive and function in society then capitalism and the state. Just an example, we have more empty homes then homeless people in this country. We have the resources and knowledge to provide mental and physical healthcare, but we don't. And all of it is economic and ideological at it's core.

&gt; I agree with what you said, but i don't think any law can bring about what you want. Rich people will always have more influence. I may not like it, but I'm willing to live with that. I'm not willing to throw a rich person in jail just for publishing a book. Are you?

If the book is politically charged, then the rich person should have no more influence in its publishing than the average citizen. If the book is actually liked, and seen to be a useful piece of literature, then it would naturally receive financing from several citizens and not just one.

That is the beauty of spending caps. If the idea is truly loved and wanted by many, the money would still come. If the idea is one-sided, lacking sense and is simply bad literature, it wouldn't get funded.

Either way the book can still be written; nobody is telling someone they can't write or talk about their ideas. It just wouldn't get to many people, because not many people liked the idea to support it either way.

It is the best way to truly weed out the bad, and promote the good.

Nothing really to say before the write up today so lets just dive straight into it!

**Episode 39**

* Huh? New OP? Barely feels like it's been two episodes since the last one. Shows how fast we are getting through the series now. Kind of scary to think this show will be over by the end of the week.
* Surprisingly little to say to say about the new OP. Simply put, we are going to see fights with the Sins from this point out. Also Hohenheim is going back to the capital, not sure why though. 
* One thing that did stand out to me was how the gate of truth crumbled apart at the end of the OP. It might not mean anything but if we are going to see it destroyed then consider me hyped.
* Probably 3rd best OP soundwise. Kono omoi wo should have just been remixed for each new OP :D
* Figured the explosion would be part of the plan
*  Al has matured since the beginning of the show. His speech to the chimeras is a nice reflection of the fight with Barry (R.I.P) at the prison 
* They were surprisingly trusting. I was with Miles on killing them. 
* Scar redemption arc is happening!
* What is it with black people having really weird lips in this show? They are like yellow it's bizarre. 
* Oh no, looks like Al's soul is beginning to reject his current body. I'm honestly shocked it has lasted this long though. An arm for almost a decades worth of time is a pretty good deal IMO.
* WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH HOLD UP. What the hell is Father planning. He has 4 sacrifices lined up for his little circle thing and they all seem to involve people who have seen the gate of truth. Is it possible he is trying to make a humunculus of Truth like he attempted with Gluttony but with, well, better ingredients?
* This ED is funky as all hell
* Definitely still intrigued by Hawkeye's back markings. Could she be the 5th piece that Father is looking for? I'm thinking that her Father (Mustangs Tutor) also encountered Truth and somehow burnt his revelations into his Daughters back. It's obvious she has some sort of scarring so it's not too much of a stretch to assume they are burn marks. Also his poor health while teaching Mustang could be attributed to missing organs like with Master Izumi. There has to be a connection here and this is my best guess so far.
* There is also a lion &amp; monkey chimera that I don't think we have met yet (or at least not revealed). 
* Some hand holding going on at the very end there. Hohenheim and a young Ed? Glowing must means something was transferred to the little guy

**Episode 40**

* If Hawkeye didn't exist I would definitely be shipping Mustang+Satsuki
* "Both your wallet and you balls are pea-sized, I see" DAYYYYYYYYYUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMM. You'd need to go to the Northern Briggs Wall just to cool off from that burn.
* Satsuki is really making every other character so far look bad. She knows exactly how to play the game.
* Title Episode "The dwarf in the Flask". Major General=Satsuki=Tyrion Lannister 
* Captain Buccanner...have we met this character yet? I don't think so
* Woah are we getting a Hohenheim flashback? Hype levels are rising.
* So he created Pride and not Father??? Did I take the blue pill and not the red pill?
* So was Hohenheim special before he created Pride? Who exactly is his master? Who did the original experiments? Is he a slave of Xerxes? How does Pride have this knowledge? 
* So it was Pride that sacrificed the people of Xerxes and not Hohenheim or Father? Is Father just a puppet of Pride? 
* So at some point Hohenheim achieves the immortality that the kind chased. By Prides design or by accident?
* This must be also why Hohenheim makes an effort to remember all the names of those in Philosophers stone, because unlike with the Sins he didn't intend for these people to die for his immortality
* Wait is that maybe Father &amp; not Pride? The whole black creature with the eye thing was throwing me off but now it makes more sense
* So my theories before about Xerxes weren't too far off. Except Hohenheim wasn't experimenting himself he was just a victim of circumstance I suppose. I'm so confused about Fathers creation though. How was he made? Who had the knowledge to make him? How does Father have such intricate knowledge on things? 
* I wonder just how powerful Hohenheim is then if he can harness the power of a nation inside his philosophers stone.
* So he can move organs just like that. No biggie. 
* Probably actually a bad thing that Izumi lives longer if she is a target for Fathers sacrificial shiz
* Well that episode messed with my brain considerably. Now I feel like an innocent child who knows nothing of the world. My theories were so close yet so far arrggghhh
* After credits scene; Ah Ed you have know idea!

**Episode 41** 

* Stop being an idealist Ed, listen to Miles
* Miles is more like Scar than he lets on
* Ah Winry you are so close!
* Woops. Even I forgot about Al
* Where the hell did Ed get a perfect replica of Al's armour in an abandoned mining village? Did he make it with alchemy?
* Starting to get a little worried that Miles will die here. I already know Kimblee won't because he was fighting those tanks in the OP and I get the feeling Scar would at least be involved in his death considering their past. Please don't kill Miles :( 
* Lion &amp; Monkey! Wonder if they will be turncoats or not
* Who the fuck knows what constitutes dynamite off by heart
* Doesn't Kimblee keep a Philosophers stone in his mouth? Don't think it matters that you threw that one away Ed
* **Yep.**
* Miles was right you dumbass. If he dies because of you...
* Now would be a pretty good time for Ed to learn eastern alchemy. That or have MayMay show up
* "I'm going to seal the wound" - You'll never be as manly as mustang searing his wounds to close them
* Can't wait to see that spare Philosophers stone be reincorporated. Maybe they can use to make Kimblee OD on the stuff?

So much has happened and so much is going to happen. I thought I knew what was going to happen and now I have no clue. All I can do is sit back and watch the world burn.

Future prediction: *Stuff. Stuff is going to happen.*

&gt; According to the prevailing sentiment in TRP, feminists like Halley don't exist.

TRP is a discussion group, so none of us can speak for it. But, speaking for myself, the problem isn't that "feminists like Halley don't exist". The problem is that feminists like Halley still want people like me to fuck off and die, and give zero fucks about the civil rights of me or anyone like me. 

From the article:

&gt;&gt; American racial history is laced with vendetta-like scandals in which black men are accused of sexually assaulting white women that become reverse scandals when it is revealed that the accused men were not wrongdoers at all... racially exploitative evasions of responsibility by white women... Similar dynamics affect gay men, lesbians, and trans individuals: being attracted to them can so shock some people that the easiest way back to equanimity is to attack them.

She has just gone down a laundry list of the typical leftoid "good" demographics, showing sympathy for each one. Later on, she backhandedly points out just who the enemy is:

&gt; committing the legal system to supporting... white middle-class assumptions

&gt; To the extent that the campus-sexual-assault movement expresses the priorities and visions of white middle-class women, it may not be providing us with everything we need to know to make fair decisions in cases involving class, race, and other key differences.

In other words "white middle class" women need to be sensitive to the needs of "race and class" differences.

**But notably absent is any remark about input from men**. Not *gay men*, not *transmen*, not *black men*, not *poor men*, but just plain *men*. 

Men are half the human race. Men are one half or any normal sexual interaction. And still there has not been word one from the feminist camp about their understandings of sexual interaction being valid, their needs being important, their perceptions being part of what we wish to normalize our sexual mores on. 

Halley wishes to be more "inclusive" in whom the white female master race has to consider when unilaterally establishing sexual mores, and enforcing them with decades-old prison sentences and other permanent life-altering consequences. She wishes them to include other voices in the discussion... but the voices of other leftoid master races: "PoCs", the underclass, homosexuals, and so on. But only them. 

She acknowledges that feminism has ceased to be a protest movement, and become the reigning power. But she stops short of the realization that *when you are the leader, you must hear all voices*. She is simply rearranging the chairs in the leftist tent, a voice in the debate of which of the core constituencies will be served. 

**A consistent and workable definition of what is rape and what is non-consent, and what sexual signals are to be used, will not ever achieved until men's understanding of these topics becomes one of the major inputs to the equation**. 

Until feminists are willing, not just to allow that to happen, but to work to make it happen, I will oppose anything else they try to do.

He doesn't really deserve any support. 

But he has been in jail for a year already, what if he *is* innocent? That would be a massive miscarriage of justice. 

The crux of the article is that the state holds the "key" to the defense, but the state is also the prosecution. In situations like this, there is law dictating what the state should do. They must bring to light all details of the case, in order to obtain the most accurate sentencing. 

In reality, District Attorneys are under pressure to obtain mostly "guilty" verdicts as the prosecution. 

So the question is: does the state, as the prosecution, have an ulterior motive behind not obtaining those chat records of the other 10 girls?

If so that would be pretty fucked up, regardless of whether or not this guy is actually a rapist/convicted. This guy deserves support as the potential victim of a systemic problem: people getting sent to jail so rich people make more money; and another one: rape culture.

That's true for any crime, really. "Normal" people who grow up "normally" don't (usually) grow up to commit murder, rape, etc etc. You have to be pretty fucked up.

So maybe they're messed up for some reason but at the same time you can't give them a free pass, so they go to prison. Like you said, nobody wins.

&gt; I'd take doing this job over a minimum wage part time fast food job. I love when guys bring up this argument because they're completely forgetting the fact that it's to their financial advantage that these jobs are available to them while women are mostly hired in horribly low paying jobs. 

Touche! I tip my fedora to you m'lady!

The garbage collector was just off the top of my head. I could've said 50% of homeless or 50% of prison population.

&gt; I'm all for changing social attitudes so that women can get into unskilled but higher paying jobs so that men can be booted out of them into minimum wage jobs ;). 

I'm sensing an undercurrent of hostility towards the male sex here. I'd go for the obvious 'daddy issues' but the little wink tells me you're a playful kitten so it's probably more due to little Johnny pulling your hair in the playground as to why you don't like those smelly boys! :p

Incidentally, those boys would be less smelly if they didn't have to collect your stinking garbage ;)

Oh, so you think Europe is oh so racist and America is fine?

Why, then, do you have a society of inequalities cleaved by race. If you are a colorblind society, why do Hispanic and Latino people earn only seventy percent of what white people do? And black people only sixty percent? Why do you *still* not have racial parity in federal politics? Why do black, Hispanic, and Latino children continue to far out-number white children living in poverty? Why did the home foreclosure crisis disproportionately affect black, Hispanic, and Latino homeowners? Why do black, Latino, and Hispanic men far outnumber white men in prisons across your country?

African-Americans comprise 13% of the U.S. population and 14% of the monthly drug users, but 37% of the people arrested for drug-related offenses in America.

After being arrested, African-Americans are 33% more likely than whites to be detained while facing a felony trial.

In 2010, the U.S. Sentencing Commission reported that African Americans receive 10% longer sentences than whites through the federal system for the same crimes.

In 2009 African-Americans are 21% more likely than whites to receive mandatory minimum sentences and 20% more likely to be sentenced to prison than white drug defendants.

In a 2009 report, 2/3 of the criminals receiving life sentences were non-whites. In New York, it is 83%. Blacks have been re-criminalized and turned into a slave labor force – that’s prison labor. This is American history.

In 2012, 51% of Americans expressed anti-black sentiments in a poll; a 3% increase from 2008.

A survey in 2011 revealed that 52% of non-Hispanic whites expressed anti-Hispanic attitudes.

Even Ronald Reagan was an extreme racist – didn’t hide it – but the whole so-called drug war is designed, from policing to eventual release from prison, to make it impossible for the black male community and, more and more, women, and more and more Hispanics to be part of American society.

Gone is the overt, violent, and legal racism of the 20^th century. It has been replaced by a subtler version.

It is a racism that is easier to ignore, easier to deny, and consequently almost as dangerous.

Saw this in an European jewpaper as the number one headline today, as if such things concern Europeans (beyond getting brainwashed that white people are bad mkaaay).

Summary: Poor negro has a broken taillight - gets stopped by cop - runs away cause that's what people do if they "didndu nuthin wrung" - gets shot - cop allegedly lied about him stealing his taser and gets his ass torn up by the press worldwide.

Must suck to be a cop in the US. You either get killed by a nigger or you don't even stop them, as you know things will end badly either way. 

When you deal with niggers you pretty much must be prepared to get crucified and most likely demoted, if not fired or imprisoned when you inevitably kill one when he runs away / makes some quick move that indicates he might go for his gun.

Is this guy messing with us? Peonage has been a problem in southern slave-holding states for many years and many blacks were falsely accused of crimes (especially around harvest time) and arrested, convicted by a justice of the peace, and sold to farmers or even industrialists (especially in Alabama with coal mines). Fines were levied and when you could not pay the fine, well, you could work it off.

The Louisiana prison system looks like peonage to me, as jails/prisons will often trade skilled mechanics that they need for other favors.

&gt; Apparently statistics say 1 in 3 black males will find themselves incarcerated sometime in their lifetimes... would it be fair to say that most black men are criminals or in jail? Fuck no, that's racist as fuck and simply isn't true. It's not fair to say "most" when the data doesn't support the argument of "most".

apples and oranges.  This data is saying 40% of departments do bare minimum,  20% or so do Slightly better... only 10% do a really good job of training.  

That 60% is what equates to "Most" in my eyes and the eyes of the article writer.  Even though the worst of them is only 40% or less, the total of sub-par results was beyond 50% in total by a significant amount.

&gt; So, using the data collected from 312 agencies, is fair?

This is how representative samples work. 

We pass our laws and establish MANY of our governmental standards for the entire population based on sample sizes of mere thousands of people.  

It makes scientific sense to take a big enough sample size (2000-3000 of 318 million people is considered acceptable) and then apply lessons learned to what the likely results are for the rest of the population.  

312 out of 18,000 is actually a really large sample size when you compare this study to other research.

I was just reading through this thread and I feel like you got a lot of unnecessary abuse.  You probably realized that was coming and I applaud you for doing this anyway and even responding to it.

I'll level with you, I'm skeptical when it comes to police and the whole "over militarization" part.  However, I'm not anti-police.  I think there are a lot of ways we as a society could improve, but I'm definitely do not think police officers are inherently bad.  There are some bad seeds, that is for sure.  Police officers are awesome though for the most part.  The system is a little crappy, but the people are not.

One question I do have for you though, and I'm sorry if you have already answered this as I did more skimming than thorough reading.  How do you feel about the bias when it comes to people of color especially when it comes to nonviolent drug crimes?  For example, in our prisons we see much higher percentages of black americans and latino americans than white americans, especially black men.  However, evidence shows us that all races tend to use drugs at the same rate, even if they use different drugs.  Do you think this is do to over-policing of poor or historically black neighborhoods? Or does racial-profiling possible play into this?  

I respect your willingness to talk about these things so thank you for the AMA.

I think my favorite part is the people that are suddenly pitching a fit about the US Justice system.  Like, its a-okay to lock up everyday people, but when it happens to a millennial white upper class tech nerd suddenly that's when the prison system needs reform.

It depends on the crime. Those previously convicted of a crime struggle to find a job, because no one wants to hire an ex-felon, especially if it's a theft charge. You don't want someone stealing your inventory. As a result, many struggle to find jobs, and are stuck on the street, so they just end up stealing again to support themselves.

Saying our current generation doesn't fear prison doesn't seem very true, I imagine people fear it no more or less than 50 years ago. It's still certainly a deterrant for crime. It certainly depends on the crime, prison may act as a bigger deterrent for certain crimes than others, regardless of the sentence. It all comes down to the motivating factor in committing the crime.

**IMO, the best way to prevent crime is to address each crime differently.**

-Drug usage should be met with rehab, not mindless jail sentences in which they just sit around in boredrom with nothing to do. With the current system people just go back to drugs when they're let out, you're literally just wasting time and money locking them up, and wasting their lives away.

-Any sort of extreme crime like mass murder should be life without parole, they're not mentally stable, so it isn't safe to release them. Sociopaths are known to be manipulative, so they may fake signs of change to be let out, only to do the same thing again.

-Illegal business practices like price fixing should be met with severe fines, not just a slap on the wrist like what happened to HSBC. If fines don't outweigh potential profits, why bother following the law? Maybe even arrest the executives in charge of the illegal decision, if their choice can be proven.

-DUIs should be met with revoking a driver's licence temporarily and a large fine, followed by an addon to their car that requires them to take a breathalyzer test prior to starting up their vehicle(this should prevent them from doing it). If they somehow repeat offend, a jail sentence should occur.

&gt; if lawmakers want to ensure only guilty people get condemned,

Except there simply is no way to ensure this. Compelling evidence shows that the justice systems in North America are overwhelmingly unfair to the poor and disadvantaged, and that cops and prosecutors regularly subvert justice to wrongfully convict innocent people. Hell, some  prosecutors will even jail people for murder, after a jury refuses to convict the accused, to win political points.

&gt;Cherelle Baldwin has been in prison for 21 months for killing her abuser, [despite the fact that a Connecticut jury refused to convict her of the crime](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/03/this-21-year-old-woman-faces-decades-in-prison-for-trying-to-escape-her-abuser/).

Anyone who supports the death penalty is supporting the continuing state-sanctioned murder of innocent victims and the systemic abuse of persons of colour, the poor, and mentally challenged. This is morally bankrupt, and no civilized country does this.

well actually we have! Probably before you were born. People with mental health issues used to be thrown into prisons along with convicted felons and the like.
