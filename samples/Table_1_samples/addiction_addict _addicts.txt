Weren't these trees deemed unsafe by an arborist, and thats why they're being removed? Regardless, maybe we do need a building? Like a parking lot, or a residence hall.

Even if the trees are being removed to get rid of the homeless, drug addicts, and sketchy street kids, good fucking riddance. I shouldn't feel unsafe walking NEAR, let alone through a park that is campus property aka something my tuition pays for. 

The school hasn't let public opinion of the park decline. It is the actions of people like you who prevent anything being changed at the park that led to the mess its become. Every single time the school tries to clean things up and make it a usable park some lunatic hippie throws a fit. Newsflash, they can't make it a nice usable place without booting the homeless squatters, but that is something "unacceptable" to you and the other people protesting. Go fuck yourself. I'm staging a counter protest.

I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness for 13 years of my life. I had no friends outside of the congregation and a lot of the children in the congregation didn't like me because of my father. (I'll get to that later) 

I have never celebrated my birthday, I have never celebrated Christmas, I have never celebrated Halloween or Easter. None of it. I barely celebrate New Years eve. 

As a child I had a lot of pride being a JW, I felt like I knew something others didn't and I was more educated in religion. Which really, I was. It's a religion that teaches of other religions, I was one of the only children in my class that had a firm understanding of what is entailed in my religion and I liked to preach when asked why I didn't celebrate things. Something I do to this day, but in a different manner. 

One of the main reasons I left as a JW was because one of the Elders had a Shepherding call for me. A Shepherding call is when the Elders decide something is wrong, and make a personal call on a family. I told them, proudly, that I was preaching in school that I was a JW and that I teach children in my school. One of the Elders sat me down, looked me right in the eye, and told me that I am not a Jehovah's Witness and it is wrong of me to be telling people that and that I am doing Satan's work. Despite insisting that I am in fact a JW, he would not let it drop. I cried myself to sleep that night.
Note/Edit: To call yourself a JW you need to be baptised. Unlike Christianity you make a conscious choice to be baptised and it is usually done in your teens. At this point I was much too young to be baptised, and so I was lying to everyone I preached to. Apologises for not including that. 

My father was married to my mother for 16 years. Those 16 years, she verbally and emotionally abused him. He sought comfort somewhere else, and was disfellowshipped for that. No, I am not condoning what he did, it was wrong and disgusting. He married the woman he had an affair with and after nearly 5 years he was re-instated. (when a disfellowshippment [?] is taken back and a person may talk to other members of the congregation) He is now being mentally, verbally, emotionally and physically abused by his wife. She 'accidentally' gave him a child to make him stay, she has spent all his money and has put him in $60,000 of debt and has threatened to kill herself, and their child if he leaves her. He feels like he's obligated to stay in this relationship because of his religion. This is a man who's nearing 50 and cries himself to sleep at night because he wants to spend time with his three daughters but his wife would ruin his life if he did. This is a man who hates himself because of his religion, who suffers turmoil every single day because on the one hand, this woman is making his days a living hell, but on the other, God says it is wrong. 

After my father left my mother, my sister turned to drug abuse. My mother, being a devout JW expelled her from her house, homeless and onto the street with no money and some very serious drug addictions because it's considered wrong by our religion.

I can respect a lot of religions. I have a huge respect for Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, the list goes on. But being a JW ruined mine and my family's lives.

I had a very similar experience to yours. I knew she had emotional issues, but I thought I could handle it. I could NOT have been more wrong. Here's my two cents:

IF you decide you really want to try and make this work: 

* Is your GF on any sort of medication? Mood stabilizers, anti-depression, anti-anxiety? Is she seeing a medical professional currently? Is she seeing a psychiatrist or therapist? If the answer is NO to any or all of these, you should talk to her when she is RATIONAL AND CALM about seeking some medical advice.

* Couples therapy may also help you. For yourself, read up on co-dependence and maintaining barriers in a relationship. Also, it seems like she has some symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Share with her what you have learned, and talk about it.

* You mentioned that she is interested in marriage and kids, but you do not have the same convictions. You need to do some serious soul-searching and figure out where you stand in all of this.

* DO NOT advance the relationship (moving in together, get engaged, have kids) until you have seen some improvements here.

IF you decide that it's not worth it and you want out:

* Tell her your decision and stick to it. She will try every trick in the book to keep you. Don't fall for it and don't look back.


I'm going through a seperation with my soon-to-be-ex - a woman who has been diagnosed with BPD, major depression, medical issues, anxiety, a (former) drug addict and a master manipulator. She has no ability to maintain personal relationships and is absolute poison to anyone who gets close to her. I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT. I was so fucking wrong. I wound up married, in debt, and dealing with my own newly-found depression and anger issues. 

My advice - get out now while it is easy, learn from this person what you really want in a relationship and avoid these people like the plague. 

&gt;she is a good person, i know she is.

Good for her - let her go rescue puppies and feed the homeless. YOU are the one who has to live with the crying, the blame and the guilt trips.

You sound like a good guy and a solid friend.  


Israel is not just settlers, racism and terrorism any more than the UK is just chavs, addicts and pedophiles. You'd probably laugh if someone told you that, right? I'm pretty far right, but I'll be the first to say that even though there are some dicks in the country, it's usually a minority.  Life here is boring, people are people, same as anywhere else in the world.  There are bad apples but that's inescapable no matter what country you're in.  


I don't know where in the country your friend lives, so I'm not sure what type of folks he's surrounded by every day, but if he's not in the settlements, he's probably not going to be radicalized in the way you're imagining.  There's a chance being in the army will turn him more right wing, but there's also a chance it could push him to the left.  It all is up to his personality and beliefs.  

Have you brought this up with him before? Have you said to him what you are saying here?

Everyday I look at people in the less-well-off suburbs of my city and wonder how they turned out the way they are; ie. drug addictions, abusive families. I like to think that I'm more intelligent, more talented, and have made better decisions in my life that have lead to a wealthier and more successful life. But the truth is, as a human being, I am not superior to them in any way. I was just lucky to be born into a better situation, where I was given tools to succeed in my life. Everyday, I try to remember to be grateful for that, and give these people the same chances I was given.

So recently I was walking out of a fast food joint and a homeless guy standing outside asked me if I had a couple of dollars to spare so he could get something to eat. 

So I gave him five bucks. He thanked me, told me god-bless, and walked right past me into the restaurant and got himself some food.

And if he'd instead walked down to the corner store and grabbed himself a beer? Whatever, guy wanted a beer. If he goes and gets himself his daily fix? So be it. You ever been in heroin withdrawl? 

Yes, this could have potentially harmful consequences for the person - that junk might be the batch they OD on. That needle could be the one that gives them AIDS. And alternatively, the donation I make might go to fueling some Non-profit administrator's coke addiction or drinking habit that ruins their life.

But I'm not going to judge them because they're asking for money, and I'm sure as hell not going to feel guilty about "enabling" their potentially self-destructive behavior. They're adults, not children -  I'm just going to treat them as such, and give them a couple of bucks to do with as they wish. 

Or hey, I could always just spend that money tossing Reddit Gold at some guy on the internet. I'm sure that'll do some good.

&gt; A lot of homeless people have drug or alcohol abuse problems due to their situation, and if you give them money it is likely that it will be spent on that.

So then you are giving them money to save them from [potentially life-threatening withdrawal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-addiction/201001/alcohol-benzos-and-opiates-withdrawal-might-kill-you) Unless these people have access to reliable rehabilitation centers and medical care, why is it wrong that they spend money on not dying from acute withdrawal in the street? 
<SUB>

Ultimately, "homelessness" has a huge variety of causes, most of which don't have easy solutions no matter how much money you want to throw at them.

A big contributor is substance addiction and/or mental problems - both of which will make it very difficult to obtain or benefit from services.

Some mental problems are simply untreatable, and the alternative to homelessness is imprisonment in a hellish institution.

It can be almost impossible to get someone off drugs, especially if they don't want to. Even lengthy rehab centers are usually ineffective. 

Then you have the homeless-by-choice. They simply prefer their freedom to anything they would have to do to climb out of poverty. Why work when you can steal booze and live on someone's property for free? These people, again, can't really be helped.

There are also the faux-homeless. They often have money, possessions, and in many cases a car. They are basically nomadic con artists who float around swindling people out of a modest living. Those people who beg for gas money at the shell station? Yeah. 

Finally you have the true down-on-their-lucks. Honest people who hit some hard times and just need to get back on their feet. Thing is, these people usually DO recover. The ones that don't usually can't find work because of a shitty local economy and insufficient resources to move. We could do more to help these people, but it's important to realize that this wouldn't make a dent in the "homeless problem" because these people *aren't* the problem. And they're certainly not the people throwing their feces at you and sexually harassing passing women.

The sad fact of the matter is that for most of the long term homeless, there's little that can really be done. They don't want our help, and we probably couldn't help them if we tried. They're just a constant reminder of how utterly cruel and unfair life can be.

If we do that in a few hundred years every woman will have DDs, the average guy will be 6'4", red hair will be almost completely eliminated from the gene pool, .  I don't understand how you can't see that this reeks of classism, racism, and the breeding of a master race by anyone being able to reproduce with any type of person they want.  What if a celebrity decides to donate their sperm?  Or start selling it to the highest bidder?  How much would single mom's be willing to pay for Tom Brady or Johnny Manziel ' s genetic material?  Or George Clooney.  All the rich kids will look like LeBron James,  Pierce Brosnan, or Antonio Banderas.  I think the only thing parents should be able to know about their donors is their genetic diseases and genetic proneness to other diseases including cancer, mental illness, addiction, and even obesity if there's the science to back it up, and maybe "race" so the child doesn't feel like an outcast in their own family.

But it's not entirely wrong.  There are well funded systems in place to provide food, health care, clothing, and other necessary services to those willing to make an effort to seek them, and the effort is minimal. Most shelters operate as clean living facilities - you have to be drug free or in a treatment program to qualify.  
Far too often the people panhandling are ones who have been kicked out of those programs because they cannot get a handle on their substance abuse, and when a heroin addiction can cost hundreds of dollar a day, what percentage of that handout do you really think is going towards food and shelter?  
And that's to say nothing of organized groups of "professional" panhandlers who use deception to gain sympathy to get more money. I have personally witnessed women holding a doll in a blanket and a sign saying "homeless need formula god bless"   at one light 5 people gave her money, and not just change or a dollar,,, she was probably making $10-15 per light cycle, or in the neighborhood of $300 an hour.  
Should we use that to dismiss ALL people in need? No...   
Should we be aware that there ARE legitimate problems with giving money to panhandlers and it would be better to research better ways of helping those most in need? Yes.  
  
Just ask yourself, are you giving them money to help them, or to make you feel better by the least amount of effort? Rolling down your window and handing someone $2-3 is so much easier than signing up for a monthly contribution to The United way, RRFB, or other great local groups that will do so much more with it.

But you're wrong. There are tons of items for TF2 or DOTA2  (red skin quality, etc) that are $5 but people continue to buy the new sets/crates/items. People seemed to have bought more items on the new DOTA2 F2P shop than the previous model (Which was almost like CS:GO). An unusual new courier still goes for $100+++, just not $300 like a CS:GO knife.

The fact that a $3.00 Chroma Case + $2.50 key = 10 cent skin comic is a 1000 upvoted joke on the CSGO Steam Community hub says a lot about player perception about crates.

Easier accessible items with actual utility = more propensity to buy.

Asides from gambling addicts and rich people, most players probably will not gamble on crates because they're simply that - gambles. Who wouldn't want to pay $20 for a Cloud9 set of GUARANTEED items? Definitely some, but I'd say a much smaller minority than the present pool of players that see the whole gaben crate system as CSGO Slots gambling...

**Here the story OP posted in the comments:**

Wow, this is getting big.. Ok, so I have gotten a lot of questions, so here is the basics:
Junior year in High school I got involved with the wrong crowd (generic excuse) went to parties, got introduced to weed, then later the same week, meth, and the same night as the meth, coke. I was instantly hooked and wanted more...everything. I kept a job for most of the time after that until my urge for drugs outweighed my urge to keep a job. I went to one rehab 9 or 10 years ago, stayed clean for 6 months, then went to my old drug friends and said "look how good I'm doing" Not sure what I was thinking, but it was back to the rat race..
It was the last 2 years of my 15 year drug career that I was living from dope house to dope house, carrying my clothes and meager possessions in the car that would be repo'd after they found it when I ran out of gas one day. I'd manage to stay with people in a back bedroom for a few days, the rest of the time was spent walking from place to place to figure out who would let me stay the night and get high for free, or handyman work, or to fix their computer. Computer work was always a hobby of mine, and when your friends are high all the time, the tend to break their machines, go figure.
My enlightening, so to speak, came when my mom happened to see the truck of a friend of mine that she recognized and got him to tell her where I was currently, luckily he knew. My mom then infiltrated the dope house I was in, pushed passed all the junkies, and barged into the room I was in and caught me with the pipe in my mouth. She convinced me to leave with her, bribing me with the promise of getting me some food, and that she just wanted to make sure I was ok.
After she got me back to her house, she called my dad, (who had gotten into AA for his drinking) and he called my former NA sponsor from when I was clean before. They both showed up and asked me a question.:
"have you had enough yet"
I said yes, with tears in my eyes. I then agreed to go to a rehab for homeless drug addicts. I had to go to jail for a couple weeks because at that time I had been running from 3 different probation's.
I got a job that was on the bus line at a restaurant in the local mall, that's where I worked my way up to Store Manager in just under a year. I met my wife at rehab, her dad was one of my counselors, and she also attended the "open to the public" bible study that her dad also preached at.
After I got out of rehab, my (now) wife and i got an apartment, we got pregnant, and I got an interview at a company that was a startup, and worked my way from an intern to an IT Admin, got some training as our CRM admin, got certified and now work for the same company that is now a billion dollar global presence.
Thats it in a nutshell, I have been working the last 4-6 years to get my credit strait, and was very proud that I was able to purchase a wonderful home for my family, thanks for all the support!!
Edit: the third car is an old truck given to me for free, it was in disrepair, and I work on it/drive it for fun

Absolutely! I made this into my afternoon project, and it was a lot of fun, so thank you! 

First, what I look for in a matte shadow: I want my matte shadows to be smooth, buildable to opaque colors but not so pigmented that they can't be blended nicely or used as a wash of color if that's what I want, smooth, and with saturated color. I put together [this small album](http://imgur.com/a/TyiNY) to visually accompany my commentary. 

I only have a total of 7 matte Inglot shades, 4 of which I would definitely recommend. The shades I would recommend include 360 (a neutral medium brown), 349 (a very ashy blonde color that I actually use to contour very, very lightly with), 354 (which doesn't show up well on my arm due to my skin tone and the direct light, but is a really lovely light peach shade), and 327 (a medium-deep cool brown that is great to line my outer lash lines). These four shades are gorgeous, and I reach for them often. 

The losers of my group (which is of course my subjective opinion) are 329 (a medium-deep neutral brown), 326 (a cool deep brown), and 391 (black- please see black comparisons further in album). These three shadows are very patchy, very chalky, and just not pleasant to work with. It's entirely possible that these three are duds and the rest of Inglot's deep matte shades are great, but I wasn't willing to spend my money to find out. 

In terms of other brands, Make Up For Ever Artist Shadows are hands down my favorite shadows ever. Ever. These mattes kick up a tiny bit of power if you tap your brush into them rather than swipe to pick up color, but that's not something that bothers me. You'll see further down in my album, I've swatched four of my single MUFE matte shadows (I may or may not have a neutral shadow addiction. . . by which I mean I definitely have a neutral shadow addiction). Of these four, my favorite is M-870 (yogurt). It's an absolutely beautiful light dusty mauve. M-548 (purple grey- I have contoured with this as well, and it went *okay*, but I wouldn't reach for it over my Inglot contour shade) is a fabulous crease color for me. I actually very, very lightly bronze with M-636 if I feel I want to add a little warmth to my face for the look I'm doing. For reference, I wear MUFE Face &amp; Body in 38.

I also do generally really enjoy LORAC Pro mattes. They kick up a ton of powder, but it's not a dealbreaker for me. In this album, I've swatched LORAC Pro2 Plum and LORAC Pro1 &amp; Pro2 blacks (which are totally different. Get your shit together, LORAC.). I think they're great, but not worth repurchasing the entire palettes for, so when I run out of the matte shades and a few of the shimmers I like, I'll be done with those. 

Honorable mentions go to Burberry, and shockingly Coastal Scents. Burberry does not technically have true matte shades. They make "satin mattes", which have the slightest amount of sheen in them to avoid the chalky look that lower-quality mattes can have. I have swatched Burberry's Antique Rose, and I also own Burberry Almond, which is a warm taupe. My only gripe with these is that they're singles in rather bulky packaging, and that packaging is gorgeous/too expensive for me to stomach depotting. I rarely reach for these shadows, simply because I forget they're hiding out in my drawer. For $29 each, I would recommend other shadows over these. 

The Coastal Scents shadow in Violetta that I have is a truly surprisingly awesome shadow. I received four shades from Coastal Scents in an adorable mini sample quad with an order from them about two years ago. I only recently ever bothered to try them out because I foolishly assumed they'd be crap not worth my time. My swatch looks kind of like a gross dark brown, but the shadow is actually a really, really nice deep purple burgundy (rather than red-leaning) that works beautifully as smudged liner on my lower lash line. I don't see myself purchasing more of these, but only because I'm trying to use up what I have now, and I'm so obsessed with MUFE shadows that I'll likely purchase from them. I would strongly recommend this brand espcially for beginners not looking to spend big money while exploring their preferences and developing their application skills. 

Finally, I swatched all my matte blacks so there would be some sort of color comparison point. Inglot 391 is just gross. Stiff, dry, patchy, blech. Pass. MUFE S-102 (note, not technically a matte, but in their satin range. I do however consider this more of a matte shade due to appearance and performance. This is the only black I've ever made work for me before as I'm quite fair-toned due to its blendability). UD Crave from Naked Basics and LORAC Pro1 black are gross. Super dry, chalky, just no. Not for me. LORAC Pro2 Black isn't even black. It's a deep charcoal, and it may be me nit-picking, but I don't really even see this as a black shade. 

So that's my matte shadow roundup! Please feel free to ask any questions or for clarification/elaboration on anything you wish =)

&gt; Sorry, I cannot deduce the meaning of a response that is 1 letter in length.

... Deduce it from my IQ and mobility comments....

&gt;Exactly, you're simply validating my point. 

No. I'm validating MY point.

&gt;Junk food tastes good and is cheap, quick, and addictive.

If people knew how to eat and what to buy, they wouldn't eat that garbage. I blame the kike media putting out all this bullshit about food and health and fad diets.

&gt;You're also not a obese person with 5 kids. Horrible example. 

"There is no way to eat healthy and clean while having 5 kids and poor" LOL. I grew up poor. I ate well. I know other people who grow up poor and eat well. Horrible example.

&gt;This was never about you. 

...It went along with my comment on how much money I spend on food a week.

&gt;All you're doing is proving my point..? I'm confused, are you for my position or against it? 

I clearly said that in the OP of this thread.

&gt;Clean carbs such as brown rice and oatmeal are good for you. But you are correct, fat isn't nearly as bad as they make it out to be.(well trans-fat is awful but fats are an essential part of a healthy diet) I'll admit it was a stupid statement. I'll throw 5 math questions your way and make you look just as stupid so relax.

The thing is, I don't talk about what I don't know. ANYTHING in excess is bad. Excess carb consumption leads to diabetes. Diabetes leads to other health problems. Though, there is controversy to whether or not diabetes causes weight gain, or weight gain causes diabetes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMhLBPPtlrY

&gt;I feel that most obese people don't care. Perhaps in the back of their minds they know it's wrong to be so large, but most simply give up when it gets to that point.

You feel wrong then. They do care. They mask it with eating more and more. Food addiction is very serious. Don't talk with your feelz.

&gt;Why wouldn't I? 

Should have brought it up with your junk food part if you knew.

&gt;Yes because this couldn't possibly apply to poor, white people. /s 

Poor whites have a better chance than poor niggers. **POOR WHITES OUTSCORE RICH BLACKS ON THE SAT WHICH IS CORRELATED AT .81 WITH IQ**

&gt;Correct. Those stupid, obese, black women also tend to have several kids, who also become uneducated, fat, remain poor. Like I said, the cycle just continues. 

Obese because shit food, several kids because negros have a higher sex drive than whites and Asians on average, low IQ people tend to be uneducated.

&gt;Well I suppose because you(apparently, not convinced) have an above average IQ and are well, rather unsuccessful. And in my eyes, quite poor. Thank god you didn't have kids at a young age. 

Love how you always have to throw me into our debates. Your obsession with me is CRAZY. Yea, I didn't have kids at a young age because I'm not an irresponsible nigger. Don't worry about me, nigger. I'm in a good spot in life and will be successful. Focus on the debate for 5 minutes other than your clear unhealthy obsession with me.

&gt;Well, I could link the image of you but I don't want to witness another chimpout so I wont. But you are very scrawny lol. Saying otherwise just proves how delusional of a human you truly are. 

Lol. Again, your obsession with me is crazy. &gt;scrawny. Yea, angles tell a huge story. You're such a homo. One of the funniest people I've ever encountered on Reddit, and that's saying something.  I've had tons of run ins with idiots, but you HAVE to be the cream of the crop. Shows how obsessed with me you really are.

&gt;No it is not. It's about how poor people tend to be obese and stupid, have lots of kids, and have to spend their grocery money on cheap, shitty food to feed said kids. Nothing to do with nutrition. 

 &gt; nothing to do with nutrition. Wut. Really? IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH NUTRITION.

&gt;The stomach thing was a stupid statement, i'll admit that. But another than that you didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know..

Clearly, I did. You said fat people have big stomachs. I proved you wrong. No idea where that logic comes from.

&gt;I've got off of work 9 hours ago. I've had a ridiculous amount of free time today. 

To troll a board where you're hated, first for being a nigger, second for being a moron. Cool way to spend free time.

&gt;It appears you have agreed with most of my initial points if i'm not mistaken. Are we done here? Or are you just going to keep showing me your extensive knowledge of nutrition?

You tell me if we're done here. I don't want you here. You're scum. A nigger. I enjoy talking about nutrition. Which I know is shocking because imanaziwhowantstokill6gorrilionjews.

I've got family with addiction as well. I evicted my sister and she had to live on the street. The only thing I was able to do is give her references to rehab facility and let her know I would be there for her when she was ready to be sober. Never lose hope. My sister had been clean for 8 years after being a homeless addict. However be cautious in your hope. It's a rough road you and your sister face

&gt; The FDA used to warn, “If you consume 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day, ask your doctor whether you should take acetaminophen or other pain relievers/fever reducers. Acetaminophen may cause liver damage.”
In 2011 the FDA took a much tougher stance. It advised: “not drinking alcohol when taking acetaminophen.”

[The People's Pharmacy](http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2012/11/08/tylenol-alcohol-acetaminophen-side-effects)

&gt;The warning label included on acetaminophen packaging does say not to take the medication with alcohol, Ndetan said, "but it is important for people to receive this message because people will take them despite those warnings."

&gt;It's not known if similar interactions occur with other painkillers, he said.

&gt;In general, people who regularly consume one should not use the other, Zand said.

So I went to my best friends wedding in Oslo and over dinner I remarked that there seemed to be no homeless people.

He said yes "Even the heroin addicts have a place to sleep" and that the only "homeless" people were those who wanted to be. He used an eccentric wealthy person he knew as an example who enjoyed sleeping outside.

The way they used to get around begging is by asking for spare change "to use a payphone".

Norway's oil revenues ensure they actually have the ability to tackle homelessness and they seem to do a pretty good job. At least when I was in Oslo last they did

Dear Victim,

Just had to let you know how impressed I was with your vituperative, heroic rant. So proud of your mastery of FU!  Certainly one way to set yourself apart.  So few in this world are able to express themselves in just those two words, and here you go, a mere Toddler.  Beaming!

And then there's this.

1) I think it's pretty apparent in most cases of "warm fuzzies" inspiring us in investment schemes, it's more us being inspired by our own greed than anything else, much as we would like to rationalize that and get ourselves off the hook.  Not just Mormons, but members of any religion/cultural group seem super prone to trust other members of their group rather than using due diligence to balance this vulnerability.  I mean, who are we kidding?  Do we really think that a God who counsels us not to lay up treasures on earth where moth and rust doth corrupt is really going to be into helping us max out just in case we go off the deep end and ignore Him?  Plan B?  So you have no complicity in this decision to hand over your dough?  So convenient.  

Over and over I have heard and read testimonies of people who have faithfully paid tithing and ended up too short to pay the electric bill or unable to buy groceries or medicine at the end of the month, and lo and behold, a check arrives for $38.72 at the last minute or a bag of groceries arrives on the doorstep, yada, yada, but never it seems a stock certificate for 10,000 shares of Microsoft. Help arrives, but not the whole Publisher's Clearing House staff with balloons.  Though maybe I was always in the wrong Ward....   It seems to me that concentrating on making more and more is having one's eye off the mark, and makes you susceptible to "inspiration" from a lot of other sources.  I just don't think that a spiritual being is going to guide you to millions, but I will keep praying for the appropriate lottery numbers, desperately hoping to be an exception to the rule.

2) Whoa, premarital sex in a Church that teaches abstinence from such.  I think that's not a first. No Get Out of Jail Free card.  Do not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200.  Pay the price.  Stop.  Change.  But then. Blaming a religion that teaches fundamental repentance (in no uncertain terms) for you not forgiving yourself for ANYTHING is pretty absurd.  How can you even begin to pretend you know the first thing about Christianity, much less "Mormonism"?  If someone told you any different, it just means that there are idiots running around, in and out of the Church.  Why would you choose to believe idiots?  You do have a responsibility to find out what is drivel and what is truth.  Period.

3) Spending one's time in meetings, service, etc. while simply cheating you, has blatantly taught and inspired me to be a better me, to try to give my best to my family and to the world on every level.  Sure, I have failed miserably every day and often I have been defeated rather than inspired by my own inadequacies.  Who's to say I would have used that time as wisely in other pursuits?  Truthfully, maybe I would have watched Reality TV or read banal books or called up my old high school boyfriend....  I don't resent the time I spent even though it could have been scaling Mt. Everest or running marathons, spoiling my kids even more or perhaps devoting untold hours to an illustrious career.  Traveling the planet, opining on the editorial page of the Times, facilitating world peace.   You know, people spend time in meetings and STILL do all that. 

4) For all the money I have given to the Church.  Yeah, that is a bitter pill.  Especially discovering that it doesn't go where I would have directed it to according to my own knowledge and wishes. Pretty much like taxes. Grrrr.  Even Charities I have given to have more than disappointed me.  I do absolutely think giving and sacrificing is a good practice for refining self and helping others, but I have found other ways to do so now.  I do have the consolation of looking back on monies spent and knowing some of it went for good causes, not just malls and office buildings. Then again, maybe looking back is pointless.  So I look inward as well at my own spending patterns and acknowledge I am less a good steward at times.  (At this point I have a problem with the rampant corporatocracy we now live in creating such disturbing imbalance, but I digress.  If you have accrued millions, obviously it works for you.)  

5) For not having the courage to live an authentic life and blaming others for that, who the heck are you kidding?  8 years in hiding.  If you are seized with the fear that your "friends" will abandon you, your definition of friendship is seriously out of whack.  It only seems logical that you would assume how your friends would act based on how you would act towards them were the situation reversed. Unless you live in a bubble, in Utah it seems likely from time to time you would have encountered people who have left the Church.  If that didn't change the status quo for you about them, why would you think people would forsake you when you walked in those moccasins?  And even if the "worst" has happened and people have shunned you, at least you must have the admiration of the one person who mattered the most - you.  Really, losing friends who are merely acquaintances is not loss of friendship.  It's a favor.  Culture of fear?  Read a book or two about the Holocaust, or go live in Yemen.  If people ARE avoiding you, do you think there's a possibility that it's not what you've done, but how you've done it that could have anything to do with that at all?  Seething anger, even if under the surface, is not often all that charismatic.  Just sayin'.

6) Congratulations on having such a beautiful, kind, delightful daughter.  I expect she was born with a predisposition to be gentle and loving, but exposing her to the ideals she has grown up with to this point in FHE, I suspect has reinforced all that is lovely within her.  Or somehow done irreparable harm.

No idea what a TBM mom is, but bitchy is ubiquitous, no?  Even where it shouldn't be, and then it's especially sharp. The Church isn't responsible for this woman's using her idea of religion as a weapon.  The woman is.  Your daughter can learn to be an even more beautiful person through the pain of being treated badly by her misguided friend.  It is important to see exactly what we don't want to choose to become, maybe just as important as seeing the good examples of what we want to become. What is even more critical to your child's present and future happiness is how you choose to guide her at this difficult juncture.  Is your bitterness what you really want to influence her?  Can she become her greatest self by understanding and forgiveness?  Or will she drink from your vial of poison and find no antidote?  None of us would deliberately choose to have pain inflicted on our children, but it doesn't mean it won't happen even in the best of circumstances, or that it has to be the controlling moment in their lives.  I don't know if you have rejected Christ or not, but the bittersweet experience he and his Father let him be exposed to and suffer through will have all the more meaning for your daughter because of what she endures with grace.  Or not.  But yes, there will be tears.  And heartache.  It's real life.

7) Your sister is in charge of her own life.  Maybe she should have married the shy kid in high school, or that good friend in college. Maybe she still will marry the guy at work next year and have a better sex life than you, maybe 50 shades of chartreuse.  Maybe she'll become a latent lesbian.  These are problems for YOU?  She alone gets to decide what she wants and what she doesn't. There are fine lines between flirting with something and becoming addicted.  No one can accurately predict where that is for an individual.  Not even the individual.  Who are you to know what her life would be like if she married a man "addicted" to porn? Addicted to anything?  Wow!  You have no idea of what that entails.  Although you do seem prone right now to an addiction of bitterness and arrogance.  I wonder what the consequences of being married to you are like.

8) Ok, so your family, according to you, is uptight and judgmental.  As they say, the apple sure doesn't fall far from the tree.  Why not try forgiving them and showing them how it's done?  But right, I remember vaguely over and over being instructed NOT to be Christlike and loving.  It's all coming back now, all those hours of being diligently taught, where it was just a kind of code continually elucidated ad nauseam to be Christlike and loving (and given opportunities left and right in this life to demonstrate just that).  Wink, wink.  They didn't mean that AT ALL!  You kinda had to read between the lines, right?

9)  The gay card.  Or the race card (can't remember when the Blacks didn't have the Priesthood?) Yep, people have wrestled with these injustices since forever.  And mishandled them too.  There is no defense anywhere for people being mistreated for whatever reason, and it has taken time and evolving for things to change, in secular society, in Churches, in hearts and minds everywhere.  All you can do is examine your own heart and mind and advocate for change therein and then step up to the plate and do so on a public level and make progress. The Spanish Inquisition was horrible, gay bashing and persecution and everything in between is reprehensible as well.  A total twisting of everything Christ espoused.

One thing to keep in note is that these are mere moments that then have to be compared with the good that this caretaker does. A couple evil acts for the sake of ultimate good reads more neutral than evil. Furthermore, we must look at context behind these acts. He broke the arm of a child abuser? That actually reads as very good, as it's in defense of the helpless. Even if he murdered the man, it's still not evil, and the fact that he could feel guilt over it heavily pushes him toward a Good alignment. Gambling and buying liquor with orphanage money? Well, that's not good. Whether or not that's evil or just selfish depends on the wealth the orphanage has. If it doesn't have much, then it's evil, for sure, but if he's only spending excess, then that would be more neutral, in my eyes. A gambling addiction, on the other hand, is not something that can be read on an alignment chart, as it is an addiction. It's involuntary, it's an illness of the mind. Furthermore, he steals to keep the kids fed? Well, who is he stealing from? Beggars? Evil. The wealthy? Neutral, maybe even (chaotic) good. These things need context. 

Furthermore, as was said by others, it Detect Evil merely detects an evil alignment, not these specific events. Sure, these events can result in a change in one's alignment, but they are not the alignment itself.

Yeah, but in some cases the money isn't enough or the application process is too long and they are homeless before they get the money. Most homeless vets get money, its just not enough to live on and they aren't able to hold a job because they can't get enough services to help their PTSD and resulting addictions. 
I was a case worker for a veterans program for a year. I only lasted a year. It was the worst. The suicide rates, filling out paper work and seeing them be desperate and only being able to say, 'well, I submitted it. we just have to wait.',  not having housing for them so at 5pm after hours of calling they were back out to wander another night on the streets. Ugh, I felt awful.

I was afraid that you'd latch onto the word "solvable". It's a poor choice of words. What I meant was, why do you separate greed from delusion or anger? 

The Western way of living, based on greed and echoes of "manifest destiny" is obviously not the only way to live.

&gt; This is not a solvable problem

Right. The vow is an orientation, not a promise...

&gt; Our maybe unluckier if the full weight of this vow is felt.

Definitely unluckier.

&gt; And yet, we are not excused from doing anything about it. But we also can't claim our efforts made any difference. 

You can certainly claim that your efforts make a difference; it's just that you can't quantify what the difference is. David Koch and John Rockefeller do and did make a huge difference in our effect on the environment, for instance. 

I see way too much of this sophisticated apathy, and I'm sure you do, too. "Why bother being vegetarian -- my diet won't make a difference", "why bother voting...", "why bother driving less..."

I hear you saying to take responsibility. I'm saying, consider what you're choosing to take responsibility for, and when you're choosing to avoid responsibility (if that's the case). 

&gt; The old way was to live life as a beggar, making no demands on life other than what folks would give voluntarily. The thinking behind that was deep. But today we see the homeless and beggars as unproductive burdens on the world. How is that for inverted thinking?

It's not like homeless people are automatically sages... We see beggars as burdens because they often are burdens -- struggling with addiction and receiving a lot of medical care paid for by the community. Obviously, the phenomenon of monks begging is accepted in asian cultures, but not so much in the west. But that doesn't mean that the only alternative is to be a suburbanite.

Look at the life of Layman Pang and family. It was extremely austere by our standards. They'd be some kind of hippie/hillbilly recluses today. Sometimes you hear about such people who live remotely in Alaska or whatever. They're most likely not Buddhist saints, but they're making a choice to go in a different direction. 

If you (or anyone) are going to choose to practice "right in the middle of it", then fulfill your responsibility by making a difference within whatever situation you find yourself. Be in the world, but not of it, dig?

&gt; Sadly, you're in the minority of players.

Why would you think that? I know lots of people who occasionally buy lottery tickets. I know zero that are gambling addicts, though I know they exist. I personally spend somewhere around $50 a year, at most, on lottery tickets. I'm buying the "what if" daydream for that tiny bit of money.

I think the vast number of people who buy lottery tickets do so as a few dollars every now and then and the problem gamblers are in the minority.

Especially if we retrained them and then hired them to actually help educate the public toward using drugs, for healing reasons and exploring new realms of consciousnesss and for overcoming addictions, instead of having them support a system of lawyers and judges and prisons and prison guards rather than clinics and doctors and nurses.

This pretty much describes my parents position on the matter. They believe themselves to be typical hardworking, middle class, red state folks. 

After years of complaining about the homeless being "common criminals" and "lazy drug addicts" two of my siblings were diagnosed with mental illnesses and started self-medicating. This happened at different times and over years of course. 

Obviously my parents changed their tune and did everything in their power to help my siblings kick their habits, get treatment for their mental illnesses  and help them lead healthy lives. 

Just kidding! My parents yelled at them, denied the problem, cut off contact, and now when some one brings it up they act like nothings wrong with their kids and they still think there's something wrong with everyone else. Meanwhile my siblings are homeless addicts with zero support. I tried for as long as I could and have blown through thousands of dollars trying to help them and considering I've also cut off contact with my parents I can't bear the weight of everyone. Addiction counselors have tried explaining to my parents that a decent support system is worth more than money in cases like this. They don't care.

Gonna share something that came up in my FB feed: 

&gt;It’s difficult for me to wrestle with what’s happening in the city I love right now. On one side, I have close friends and loved ones who rightfully fear for their safety today. On the other side, I see people who could be my former students and their families letting out a rage resulting from generations of oppression in their communities. While I worked through these feelings, I thought about what I’d say to my DC students, who I am proud of and extremely fortunate to teach, but who are safely nestled in the independent school system.

&gt;I would tell them that neither of us can truly comprehend what growing up in the projects of West Baltimore is like. An environment where you are offered so few opportunities to succeed in comparison with your more affluent peers. Where no one around you really grows up to be doctors or lawyers. Where you were literally poisoned by your childhood home with the lead paint the government painted on your project walls. That same home that was never quiet enough to read in or do homework in because of the seven other people crammed into that small home with you. Where because your parents work multiple jobs and can’t afford childcare, you are in charge of parenting your younger siblings when you get up in the morning and when you get home from school. In this neighborhood, the arrest rate for African Americans is three times that of other races - 5 times more than whites for marijuana possession even though whites are more likely to possess marijuana than blacks. Your neighborhood is in a food desert where the closest place with produce is more than a mile away and the produce is well out of your price range to begin with. There are no reliable forms of public transportation to get you to a grocery store, and imagine carrying enough food to feed a family of five on a crowded city bus. The government provides your lunch and breakfast at school, but breakfast consists of off-brand sugar cereal and cookies every morning. Your school system is so broken that only 2-8% of Baltimore city students will graduate from a 4-year university. Your community is ridden with drug addiction, violence, and a dark history of police brutality, with over a hundred people killed by the police since 2010 alone. Because of this, your life is survival. You grow up with anger in your heart. This is the very real life of hundreds of teens in Baltimore, and we cannot comprehend the strain. And because we are in no position to comprehend it, we are in no position to place our condescending judgment.

&gt;My juniors should be reminded of Langston Hughes’s famous poem “Harlem,” that we read in the winter, a poem that reflects on the race riots Hughes witnessed in his own community. It’s thesis: when you defer the dreams of thousands of people, you get an explosion. Victims like Freddie Gray have come to represent this deferment of dreams and it has sparked violence like it did it Ferguson. That is what we are seeing on our televisions tonight in Baltimore.

&gt;Is this violence justified then? Is it productive? Is it righteous? It was so easy for me to read the coverage of the riots in Ferguson and say yes, this is righteous; it’s the culmination of decades, centuries of oppression and marginalization. I am now faced with my own hypocrisy when I pour over images of my city looted and on fire and can’t accept that the destruction of homes, citizen property, and a construction site for a future senior citizen center is justified. But it is not something we can condemn or wag our fingers at either. We, who stand from our comfortable vantage point of running water, 3 square meals a day, and coats in the winter. It reminds me of a passage from James Baldwin, when reflecting on the destruction and looting in the Harlem riots:

&gt;“None of this was doing anybody any good. It would have been better to have left the plate glass as it had been and the goods lying in the stores. 
It would have been better, but it also would have been intolerable, for Harlem had needed something to smash. To smash something is the ghetto’s chronic need. Most of the time it’s members of the ghetto who smash each other, and themselves. But as long as the ghetto walls are standing there will always come a moment when these outlets do not work.”

&gt;Because, what did we expect? What happens when you deny an entire population of people quality nutrition, healthcare, housing, and education - when you defer their dreams - for decades, for generations, for centuries? You get an explosion. America, more than any other country, should know this. We’ve had a cycle of race riots in low-income areas since the end of slavery. Have we already forgotten the Harlem race riots of the 30’s and 40’s? The King assassination riots of ‘68? The Rodney King riots? All you have to do is go to Wikipedia to know that a race riot has happened in this country at least almost every three years for the entire 20th and 21st centuries. Violence and riots are the tried and true results of impoverishment, brutality, and marginalization, especially when occurring along racial lines.

&gt;I would also be remiss if I did not include my own experience with the protesters on Saturday. Saturday, I marched with over 1500 peaceful men and women dedicated to ending police brutality in their city. I have been to several protests, but none with the amount of congeniality that this one had. Strangers introduced themselves to one another and became marching friends. When I knocked into a marcher from Freddie Gray’s neighborhood, she smiled at me, asked where I was from, and thanked me for coming out that day. At one point a protester climbed on a car, but the crowd pulled him down. “That’s not what we’re about today!” a handful of the protesters shouted at him. There was a real sense of community and dedication to justice in that crowd that day that was lost on the media and on our mayor. Stephanie Rawlings Blake would later say she was “profoundly disappointed” at the way the protest ended that night, even though the organized protest had ended before sundown. I would like to speak on my personal PROFOUND DISAPPOINTMENT. I was “profoundly disappointed” that even though thousands of her citizens were at her door at City Hall asking for justice, she couldn’t be bothered to make an appearance. I was “profoundly disappointed” that her city had been falling to pieces long before the riots started, and only now was she taking notice. I wonder if this taking notice has anything to do with her “profound disappointment” that these riots will likely ruin her chances of ever running for governor.

&gt;So I hope we don’t see the one-sided footage of violence on TV and gain firmer-held stereotypes of our inner-city brothers and sisters. Because truly, you do not know that you would not react the same way to institutionalized racism and marginalization. I hope that we see reflected in the flames of Baltimore our society’s persistent failure to help those who need help most. I hope we don’t feel a sense of superiority over those engaged in riots, for it is a false superiority, one based on the simple fact that we were born into better circumstances than others. Rather than turn our noses up at the people of the city I love, Charm City, I hope this becomes a national opportunity for us to learn compassion for those dealt a much worse hand than us, to feel gratitude for the opportunities we are given, and more than anything, to acquire a real sense of urgency over fixing the systemic problems that so afflict the impoverished people within our own cities. It’s easy to look at violence and say that it’s bad or good, but it’s much more difficult to contextualize violence in the very real socio-economic setting of Baltimore. As one of my teacher friends eloquently put it, Baltimore has been in a state of emergency long before these riots, and most of us should all feel at least partly ashamed for not noticing.

Now that I don't have the answer to. OP's article says a large portion of his congregation is poor, homeless, or addicts.  My guess is his church has so many members that pay as much as they can afford out of their meager incomes that those small tithes add up big times. Around here mega churches are frickin everywhere.

&gt; Did you consider that 2 lb. Jumbo jar of peanut butter?

I love this especially. It sounds just like my roommate who is alternately freaking out and trying to over-plan my hike.  On the freaking out side, she conflated trail shelters with homeless shelters and envisioned me bunked up with addicts and bums. (I didn't have the heart to tell her about the 'facilities' at trail shelters.) On the over-planning, she wants to load me up with groceries and medical supplies. It's been very hard to convince her that I want three days' food, plus a little buffer, but not more.

Good luck with your departure!

Economics and finance would probably be one way to give you a good start. There's A LOT out there that changes the way homelessness is dealt with and how they help people. If you're in the U.S., Housing and Urban Development might be one government agency you'd be interested in. 

You may also be interested in anything related to drugs, addiction, and mental illness. Many people who are homeless are in that situation for one of those reasons. Economics/finance then changes how they can or should deal with their situation, as well as how the government as a whole helps them deal with their situation.

Get out of this marriage. I am sorry but you are in an abusive marriage, your husband has been physically and emotionally abusive and very controlling and keeping you secluded by picking who you get to have as a friend. 

You are not broken, you are a strong woman for getting past your addictions, that would have been incredibly difficult to do. You are not letting your mental illnesses control you either, which also shows that you can be very strong. 

It may not seem like it but men like your husband are really dangerous and you need to get out of this marriage, it is so toxic and you deserve so much better, you deserve to be treated equally and given freedom to do what you want. 

Do not let your husband see this post.

The source was a doctor I talked to who has been working in a long term drug treatment facility for several years.  He said the wealthy heroin addict can live normally until the last year or even the last month.  When it catches up with him, there is nothing medical science can do.  He named some jazz musicians who had died this way but I forgot the names.

Ok but norway is leaps and bounds richer than the rest of the world in purchasing power. When you can make a living on minimum wage, you cant possibly understand how shitty it is to be 30k in debt halfway through your mandatory career path's university education, have 2 jobs but not working enough hours to move out, and almost zero medical insurance if i were to move out, no dental insurance, no eye insurance, even on my parents' plans, who both work and make decent money (read: combined, still 50k less combined than the average 1 person's wage in norway) and can barely afford to live in the house my mom and my grandma and i were raised in (i pay my own bills but just not rent if im in school)

And still you get looked at like youre a homeless crack addict for not living on your own. And still cant bring girls home unless she's your girlfriend because your mom wants to make friends and be judgmental at the same time. And you still cant even have w computer in your room because this is a family house. But at least you can afford gas money to drive to school for the degree that might never do anything for you!

&gt; , "we don't want no homeless people" as usual. WHO CAN SHOVE IT.

I understand your anger, but please take a moment and really think - would you say that if they decided to put this right next door to where you live and/or right next door to where you work?

There are legitimate reasons for concern.  Concentrations of homelessness tend to also concentrate the problems of homelessness: drug use, petty crime related to drug addictions, mental illness, trash, and disease.  For businesses, this can be very bad.  People don't like to shop/eat/travel through places where their bikes get stolen/assaulted by crazy people/panhandled.  

TLDR: I understand their concern, but I'm not sure what the right answer is.

I went from being a homeless unemployed heroin addict to owning a 3 bedroom house and a Lexus outright within 5 years.  I'm about to have a meeting to negotiate a pay raise with the promotion I just got in about 10 minutes.  Being white and from a good family has everything to do with it.

Cloverdale, Fleetwood and most of Newton are actually getting worse in terms of homeless people and addicts' tomfoolery, if anything. 
Scott Road has never been a great place to live - maybe safer many years ago but never a sought after location to live. The only people who've ever lived in Scott Road are those that worked in the industries along the river and old railway. In recent years many immigration families have taken up residence here as well because the land and rent is cheap, but it's never been a very good neighbourhood, and it still isn't.

Forgive me if this comes across as sarcastic, but how much time do you actually spend out in these areas?

Edit: Done. Two posts.

&gt;First lets start off with some data for perspective. I was misrepresenting the truth. There are hundreds of thousands of subreddits. Coontown (the new greatapes) ranks in at about the 5,000th most popular sub (by subscribers). Whiterights comes in much in the lead at 3,000th-3,500th place. Unless malls have gotten drastically larger since I've been, I don't think a 3k or 5k store mall exists. So again I equate this to a small city (for perspective).

Let's put this in perspective for both the subreddits and the communities. I went to a random page in the thousands [here](http://redditlist.com/?page=9) and picked /r/engineering. It is ranked 1013th based on subscribers yet they have fewer new posts when compared to the racist groups. You can see plenty of 2 or three day old posts on the "hot" section with few posted today. Or /r/LatvianJokes, /r/HeavySeas, /r/Metalocalypse, and I'm sure there's more. I admit, I am being selective and not picking ones like Ottawa, *but* going by subscribers is a bad metric.

Then onto the community, if you really want to use the small city analogy I would consider the racist group a small, yet thriving community while the ones I mentioned have very few individuals. If reddit was a city SRS would have a large area, the redlight district would be huge, and the defaults would be the biggest. The racist group wouldn't be some seedy alley, they would be a small but very active community. If you looked into them you might notice that they all wear an identifying shirt colour (RES tag) and then you would notice that they start popping up everywhere in the city. You see them on soap boxes, you see them in your favourite small coffee shop, you see them all over. That's why I think a mall example makes sense, because although their may be tens of thousands of subreddits there are relatively few groups that produce a lot of content on reddit and post a lot. These groups would make up the "stores" rather than each sub (ie the SRS fempire would only get one store even though they have probably 30+ subs).

&gt;I would also argue that r/holocaust is a more nuanced sub than "holocaust deniers", though, I must admit, I don't frequent it.

I believe you are grossly mistaken. They currently have a sticky post ["What made you first question the Holocaust?"](http://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/2xtufm/what_made_you_first_question_the_holocaust/). The top post mentions David Irving, a man that you can say is a racist and a bigot without worrying about slander because  a court found him to be these things. The [fifth top post of the month](http://i.imgur.com/1bXlyhC.jpg) speaks for itself. These people deny the holocaust or at the very least want to make the number much lower than the entire historical community thinks it is. They are holocaust denier through and through.

&gt; Seeing as r/xkcd no longer has that on their sidebar, I can only imagine that they, as a community, decided that racism isn't the content they wanted representing them so they removed it.

Nope! They couldn't do anything because the admins don't intervene. Soccer was inactive for too long and other mods made a reddit request for the sub. I repeat, the community had no power to make changes and remove racist links from the sidebar for, IIRC, over a year.

&gt; Subreddits are representative of their content, reddit as a whole is not representative of all of its subreddits.

This statement confuses me. It's not just you, but many people say this. Reddit fosters a certain type of community and likes to paint itself as a group when positive things happen (we donated to charity!) but then when some are racist they are no longer representative. I just don't see how reddit isn't representative as the sum of it's parts that were fostered by a certain set of rules that allow particular content.

&gt;Yes, I think if you're subscribed to a subreddit that is known for brigading and stirring up drama, your lens is likely to be tinted.

I guess that's the perception. There is a vote brigade, but the "stir up drama" part is overblown by many. You rarely, if ever, see any of the regular posters in the linked drama except for some of the more notable mods.

&gt;It means I willfully expose myself to the worst parts and then judge the whole of something based on that.

I don't think all of reddit is a shithole because of the racists. I just think we are all worse off by giving them a nice comfy home and that the racist groups are actively trying to spread their bullshit in an attempt to make reddit worse from my perspective.

&gt;People don't often give negative publicity unless whatever it is directly harms people. Negative publicity is still publicity and typically only fuels resent and feeds the desire for separation (into superiority) and attention. There's a reason people say "don't feed trolls". The same applies to the circle jerk, as are the racist subs.

I disagree on a couple points. First, media is happy to give negative attention to all kinds of shit. If it's a slow news week "popular website, full of racists!?" would be an easy story to run.

Second, I think that there could be a case that there is a real potential for harm. There is a reason that hate speech is outlawed and that's because it can lead to awful things.

&gt;I think female domination bdsm is misogynistic and representative of a hatred for women. Should we know ban all the bdsm subs? Imgoingtohellforthis often displays blatant racism, should they be banned as well? 

Really? You honestly think they are comparable? I just can't understand this, on one hand you have people saying they believe anyone who has black skin is an animal. On the other you have a porn you find distasteful between consenting parties. Are you trying to make a point or do you *honestly* think that they are the same?

Further, you are well within your rights to call for the ban of BDSM pornography. I would disagree with you, but that's fine. I think more people find /r/coontown distasteful (read revolting) than /r/bdsm.

&gt;The reason the cp network was cleaned up (afaik) was that there was illegal activity involved. 

Not from my memory. First, the subs lasted for a long time until Anderson Cooper wrote a news piece. They weren't doing anything explicitly illegal in the sub itself, just posting sexualized photos of minors without actually showing sex organs. Absolutely disgusting, not illegal. There were accusations of illegal activity but I don't remember anything actually coming to light to prove them as true. It likely was as the pedophiles probably wanted more, but even if it were true how is it any different than getting advice on /r/darkmarkets or on how to choose the best weed? I guess it's a direct illegal activity to share it, but the admins could have just banned the perpetrators as an example. No, the jailbait network was shut down from bad press.

&gt;Hate speech is not illegal therefore reddit has not enough motivation to remove it.

What? I'm pretty sure hate speech is by definiton illegal. From wikipedia:

&gt;The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) states that "any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law".

Sooooo it is illegal. Do you mean speech that I find distasteful isn't illegal?

&gt;I'm sure the people at coontown don't want to be associated with a bunch o' got damned niggers either.

Then they can fuck off back to stormfront.

&gt; But that's the best part is that you don't get censored because it goes against what they think and in turn they don't get censored for going against what you think.

If they got enough voices to censor me not being racist I would move to another website. I don't give a shit about their freedoms to not be censored, I don't want them anywhere near me.

&gt; This whole topic is not about "banning racist fuckbags". If you're desire is to avoid racism you should probably not go on reddit... or the rest of the internet... or outside.

Fuck this shit. You know where I don't see blatant racism? My day to day life because I don't associate with racists. I don't see it posted and supported in subreddits I frequent (as in actually post in) except for maybe CMV because the mods aren't racist and don't want racists around. Racism exists, yes. That doesn't mean you have to just sit back and go "well that's the way of the world." No, you tell the racists that they aren't welcome and that they are wrong. Then if they try to sneak back in you tell them to fuck off like they deserve. Just because it exists and is common doesn't mean I have to accept it as normal and put up with it. That's why they would be banned.

&gt;The topic is banning subreddits (reddit could never hope to moderate racism on an acct by acct basis). Burning down a crack den does not cure the addicts of addiction just as banning subreddits does not eliminate racism.

First, they could very easily ban on a case by case basis with moderator support. They can track down chuckspears and kamensghost, they can ban some dudes saying black people are animals. Second, the goal isn't to eliminate the racists. It's to make them go elsewhere. If enough people segregate them out then they will only have their own racist networks to hang out in. They get less attention, they get less influence, and I no longer see them. I think that's great.

 [**Bubbles**](https://thewire.wikia.com/wiki/Bubbles): [](#sfw)

&gt;
&gt;Bubbles was first seen making his living as a homeless addict and best friend and mentor to Johnny Weeks. The two ran a scam creating counterfeit money with a photocopier and using coffee to stain and age it, which can make the counterfeit money look like a real dollar bill. Bubbles was successful in using the money to purchase drugs from a crew of drug dealers consisting of the teenagers Bodie, Poot, and Wallace, working for the Barksdale organization. However, when the money was passed on to D'Angelo Barksdale, the crew boss, immediately recognized it as fake. The next time, they tried the scam, Johnny was severely beaten by the three teenage crew dealers when he panicked and ran after trying to pass them the counterfeit bills.
&gt;Bubbles offered to inform on the Barksdale gang for Detective Kima Greggs, to get some measure of revenge for Johnny's beating. Bubbles' knowledge of the street proved to be invaluable to Lieutenant Cedric Daniels' unit as they investigated the Barksdale organization. He helped to identify the members of the crew that ran the Barksdale pit and those that worked in the high rise towers; he'd offer colored hats for sale and would cheerfully place them on the heads of known Barksdale crew chiefs, identifying them to nearby officers who then photographed the suspects. When Omar robbed the Barksdale stash, Bubbles was there, and gave the license plate number of Omar Little's van to Greggs, which helped the detail track down the stick-up man.

&gt; As much as everyone wants to see the good in everyone, many people are homeless because they do have an addiction. Food is not hard to afford for the homeless who live in big cities, they get a few dollars here and there all the time.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not saying this is what happened in the above case, but try offering to buy a homeless person fast food next time you see them standing outside of a market. Often they will refuse or even get angry for not just giving them cash.

I think a lot of it has to do with weather. In California, you can literally sleep outside everyday and be fine. In New York, you will freeze to death in the winter.

So without the necessity of needing shelter, the homeless do have to be treated differently. They have to be convinced that living on the streets is not worth the reason they are doing it. However, it is hard reasoning with addicts and the mentally ill.

This is why the homeless in colder climates are actually better off. It forces them to get clean to get into shelters because self-preservation is good motivator.

Maybe true for multi-thousand-dollar custom bikes-- they're hard to flip locally. But the majority that are stolen are worth far less even at retail prices. Now consider that a "hot" bike might get 1/10th of that number under sketchy circumstances so we're talking about numbers like $50 or even $20. Ever get approached by a crackhead selling bikes? I have. They're not exactly looking for MSRP, but if they can convince you to go get $200 out of the ATM of course they'll run with the scam. If you ever want to practice your bullshitting / haggling skills, find a guy selling a stolen bike and lead him around by the nose.

Seems like most stolen bikes get traded, disassembled and dispersed amongst the homeless community. Nobody's getting rich and a lot of parts are hoarded, ruined and dumped. Remember that we're mostly talking about addicts and the mentally ill, not criminal masterminds running international theft rings. It's just that, like hey, what's a used threadless stem worth, $5 at a recycler like CCC? Well maybe it's worth a buck to a guy who's trying to buy booze or drugs. It's more akin to the kind of money you'd make panhandling than, say, selling stolen auto parts to crooked body shops.

For every bike nerd posting about a fancy custom rig with sentimental value, there are dozens of everyday average bikes that get stolen, and those are the ones we rarely hear about. The crimes go unreported or even unnoticed, at least for a time.

I'm not sure that's specifically a "poor people" thing; just as many rich people get addicted to meth/heroin/crack (though they're doing it in private instead of on the street), and little glass tubes need to come from somewhere. It's not like bong stores sell fancy hand-blown-glass crack pipes for the gentleman user or anything.

Of course, the addictions of the rich can often lead to them *becoming* poor.

Its because people in this city seem to expect the homeless to disappear once they wind up on the streets. Most of them have such tragic stories that have led up to their crippling addictions, or complete financial losses. It really breaks my heart to see them get treated so callously by the majority. They have just as much of a right to exist as anyone else. They might not be dressed in the newest clothes, or have cars or homes, but theyre humans and at one point they had families and were cared for. Have some empathy for fuck sakes.

I don't think I ever wished death on anybody - I think that I just said that I had mentioned to my parents that junkies are "parasites" (I don't totally remember the wording as I deleted the post - it contained more personal information that I'm willing to put out there). My parents aren't brain dead - they know about harm reduction techniques and when I said it they looked at me like I admitted to murder. I have a close family member who is a recovering coke addict - there's no way that saying one sentence would convince my parents that all junkies should die and to vote against harm reduction. I apologize if I came off as being hostile to you - that certainly was not my intent. Far before I even touched drugs I always sympathized with drug users and it makes me sad every time I see a homeless person clearing going through withdrawals. But I certainly have not been sneaking around talking about how all heroin users need to die, I'm unsure what may have given you that impression, and again I apologize if I came off as being a dick. 

I'd imagine a few of you have experienced similar - lately I just haven't been the person I used to be. I rarely lie and now I'm going to lie to the people I love the most just for some fucking white powder, plus now I'm being a dick to strangers for no reason. I'm not using heroin as an excuse for my behavior as that comes down to me and and the poor life choices I've made - but I just want to say it:   

Fuck heroin.

There is a point in this argument in that being fat is a result (usually) of an addiction to eating. The thing is, with an eating addiction, you can instantly look at another person and see it/judge them for it, as opposed to someone who had to re-mortgage his house to pay for his crippling gambling addiction or a guy who drinks half a handle of booze every night.

It's sort of like racism (not to the same degree of discrimination in most cases) in that it's something immediately apparent that people can judge you for, and many people do judge and discriminate. If you're racist against blacks, you can immediately see that a person is black and you can be prejudiced against them. If you don't like fat people, you can immediately see that a person is fat and you can be prejudiced against them.
