Because this whole debacle is about poor communities who live in and around gangs, drugs, murder, and theft. It doesn't matter that they're black, it's not their skin color thats making these decisions. It's their brains that have been programmed to hate the police from an early age.

Poor people everywhere are largely associated with gang relation and drugs, because it's a easy way to crawl out of poverty if you're willing to subject yourself to all that comes with the lifestyle. And breaking, beating, and stealing are all things that come with that lifestyle.

So when they feel that "one of their own" was killed unjustly by a police officer, who they've been taught is their enemy since they have been linked to crime their whole lives, they go bonkers.

As soon as one dude breaks the glass of a store to steal something, everyone else groups in. Because it's already begun.

As far as Freddie being killed because the cops were racist, firstly I highly fucking doubt. If you are white and hate blacks in Baltimore, you're going to have a rough fucking time, something like 63% of Baltimore is black. So if you're a white racist you picked the wrong place to live.

Was he killed because the cops were incompetent? That's surely possible, and hopefully the law will work and the cops will get what's coming to them if that's the case/

Didn't I just say get your eyes checked?

&gt; Nobody mentions the statistic that shows us that blacks are a majority of poor and lower class, who are proven to be more likely involved in crime as well as more likely to be targeted by police. White kids in the ghetto are just as fucking likely to be slinging dope and shooting people as black kids in the ghetto.


It's clear your not interested in facts that don't agree with your position, otherwise you'd have noticed that I did attempt to give some facts.

All I got in response are racist catchphrases, appeal to emotion replies such as "**Thank God for animal control heroes like George Zimmerman, Darren Wilson and countless others who make the streets safe and the niggers good.**", yet you only see that as some sort of useful fact?

The real fact here is that ignorance and hatred are far more of a problem than any single race could ever be. You pieces of shit are a dying breed and will contribute far much more to society as compost in a graveyard than living, breathing beings.

MTV is made for teens though. I don't think they aim their music towards adults more so towards "kids" as KRS is talking about. While I agree that poor people are oppressed in general, the stats bear out in NYC that police stop and search black people a lot more. The Drug War is focused on the inner cities. 

But overall this is a good video. KRS certainly makes interesting points worth talking about.  The real hip-hop thing is meh to me.

Maybe America needs to be a police state?  Ever think of that?

The place is a mess and its mess has polluted the entire globe, with Israel's enthusiastic assistance

The world watches 'Cops' -- it sees how most offenders are mindless, drug-addicted, drug pushing, unemployed, half-stupid blacks

now Obama's introduced millions of latinos

and that's on top of the multicultural, divisive stew the US has been from the outset

White flight is fact.  White Americans want paid employment, a roof over their head and someplace safe to live

If a police state can deliver that simultaneous with ridding the US of scum, then Americans would welcome it, wouldn't they?

Someone has to clean the place up.  They need to clean up all the other nations that have been dismantled under multiculturalist policies too

If a police state could clean out the scum in my country, I'd cheer.  In addition to other benefits, it would put an end to corrupt judges letting foreigners back on the streets while citing that criminals 'came from a harsh background'

Yep, they come from harsh backgrounds, but that still doesn't mean I want them in my town

In fact, the US and its twin, Israel, specialise in orchestrating 'harsh backgrounds' for people around the world - in order they can then ship supposed 'refugees' to countries to which they have NO connection, thereafter to live on welfare in free houses while raping, robbing, bashing and killing the reluctant host populations

Damn the US and Israel.  You've earned your police states.  Now put a bloody high wall around yourselves and keep your grubby, blood-soaked hands off the rest of the world.  We are SICK and TIRED of you

Yes and no.  In most respects, metropolitan law enforcement is more honest and over-the-board than it's ever been.  However, the world has changed in some respects:

1. The police are required to enforce far more laws and those laws are far more likely to be ones people break without thinking it morally wrong.  Virtually everyone thinks murder is morally wrong.  If you murder someone and the police show up, you might fight them off - but you know you're not *justified* in doing so.  You recognize they're in the right and you're just acting out of self-interested.
In contrast, if a police officer busts you for smoking a joint, you probably think they're just hassling you.  Most people will still comply, but some folks will be highly upset because they weren't actually hurting anyone.  If you go even more obscure, think about selling someone one of your cigarettes for $.50.  Virtually no one thinks this is morally wrong - and the police interfering with such a sale would get them upset.

2. Police equipment and training has changed.  The classic model of policing is the "you can't outrun radar" model - the goal of police isn't to win every encounter, it's to win in the long run.  Police are supposed to always try to de-escalate encounters because they'll *eventually* win - no individual can really survive being worn down by the endless well of police resources.
In the modern day, an enormous emphasis has been placed on 'winning' every encounter.  If the mugger leaps a fence and gets away, you don't just let him go, log the encounter and get him next time.  You call in overwhelming force to stop him.  You see this especially with pre-planned arrests, where the police will show up with military hardware and body armor to arrest people for non-violent crimes in the middle of the night.

3. Law enforcement power has been ramped up significantly.  Being stopped by a law enforcement officer has never been convenient.  But it's also never been easier for the law enforcement establishment to utterly destroy your life without ever needing to charge you.
In theory, you have 'rights'.  But unless you've got a high-priced attorney and a lot of time, it's tough to guarantee them.  The police can simply seize your property - whether it's your rent money or your car - and they don't have to give it back until you've spent months and years fighting them over it.  Likewise, if you annoy a prosecutor enough, they can simply exile you into a hole in the ground with the right pretext.
This creates a climate where anyone who doesn't have legal representation ready to fight for them from the get-go is at a huge disadvantage.  Even if some day long in the future you win the civil case, your life is probably ruined in the meantime - lost jobs, disconnected family, destroyed reputation, etc.  Moreover, your victory won't actually punish the law enforcement apparatus in any way so there's no incentive for them to pay any attention to your rights.

So really what's happened is that we've slowly moved from a world where personal injustices - the racist cop who blows away a black kid and gets away with it because he doesn't like blacks - have been trumped by institutional injustices - the non-racist cops who merely take advantage of enormous leverage to meet quotas.

However, your perception is almost certainly related to what the media chooses to report.  There's an old joke that the homeless problem always disappears when a Democrat is in office.  It's not that homelessness changes in any way - it's just that the media uses homelessness as a way of attacking Republicans.  The same is true of these law enforcement issues - for whatever reason, people in the media decided this was the right time to talk about the issue.  The issue didn't just emerge and it won't just go away.

I think we are talking about the same quote.  The text of the speech [is here](http://www.detroityes.com/mb/showthread.php?9582-Coleman-Young-1973-Inaugural-Address&amp;p=236175#post236175).

You are right, that he does tell all crime, white or black, to head for eight mile:

&gt; I issue a forward warning now to all dope pushers, to all ripoff artists, to all muggers: It's time to leave Detroit; hit Eight Mile Road.


&gt;And I don't give a damn if they are black or white, of if they wear Superfly suits or blue uniforms with silver badges: Hit the road. 

But the speech up to this point is trying to convince the audience that the oppression that black people suffer, both "discrimination and poverty" needs to be looked at as a crime, and dealt with the same way that common crime is dealt with.  It seems to be a bit vague until he says "blue uniforms with silver badges".   He sees cop action against poor black people as discrimination, and is saying the city would be better off without those people wearing blue uniforms with silver badges.

I actually read about this speech from a blog (obviously not the strongest of sources).  It seems to me that the blog exaggerated a bit the claim of race-baiting, but it is clearly there.  He knows that the poor people of his city dislike cops and distrusts whites, and he's delivering a speech that feeds into this.

Bullshit.  Public drinking laws are used on college campuses to catch dumb kids bar crawling not to mess with the black people.  They let the poorer locals get away with it because the laws are used to fine stupid kids.  I see students of every ethnicity get harassed and the people then laws are supposedly targeting get completely ignored.   Despite the popular opinion on reddit, the police are not a bunch of racists out to fuck everyone over.  They are normal people doing a job.   If you aren't causing a problem they will leave you alone.  Drunk college kids walking around are a way bigger problem than homeless people keeping to themselves so they are the ones the cops go after.

<black, prison>
This is an awesome reply, so thank you!

A. I'm not. I'm stating that, feminism isn't the answer to men's issues, and as such, men need their own movement.

B. As to your sources:

Prison:

&gt;http://feministing.com/2013/10/29/keeping-youth-out-of-adult-prisons/

"This is a feminist issue: in the last few decades, the number of girls confined to youth prisons has been rising, and the number of women in prison is increasing at nearly double the rate for men; these are disproportionately women of color."

This is about women, not men.

&gt;http://feministing.com/2013/06/19/its-juneteenth-2013-more-black-people-are-in-prison-than-were-slaves-and-paula-deen-wants-to-bring-slavery-back/

"When discussing this issue the focus is usually placed on the incarceration of Black men, who statistics say make up 40.1% of the prison population. The rates of incarceration of Black folks in women’s prisons are ridiculously high, too."

The article then goes on to talk about women in prison.

Violence:

&gt;http://feministing.com/2014/12/15/video-tens-of-thousands-march-against-police-violence-in-nycs-millions-march/

This is an article about a march organized by two women in regards to police brutality. The word 'men' doesn't even appear.

&gt;http://feministing.com/2012/04/24/quick-hit-rally-held-in-sydney-to-protest-police-violence-against-indigenous-community/

This article is about two men who were shot by police officers, whilst possibly committing criminal acts. It focus's on the fact that the men were indigenous, and offers no reflection on men's or male issues.

Homelessness:

&gt;http://feministing.com/2014/11/06/fort-lauderdale-is-arresting-people-for-the-crime-of-giving-food-to-the-homeless/

Article about people being arrested for giving food to the homeless, which goes on to attack conservatives. Again, the word men or male doesn't even appear.

&gt;http://feministing.com/2012/12/10/activist-will-run-across-bk-bridge-in-heels-to-support-homeless-lgbtq-youth-affected-by-hurricane-sandy/

Article about the abuse women and lgbq people faced in the wake of hurricane sandy. Features an interview from a male on why this run was important to him. At a stretch, this fits the bill.

Sex Crimes:

&gt;http://feministing.com/2009/04/14/when_men_are_sexually_assualte/

Absolutely fit's the bill.

&gt;http://feministing.com/2013/05/03/feministing-chat-kitty-pryde-takes-on-rape-culture-and-danny-browns-on-stage-blow-job/

Again, fit's the bill, but sort of wanders into female issues as the article progresses.

Depression:

&gt;http://feministing.com/2014/05/09/dear-depression-and-self-loathing-fuck-you/

Article about a man discussing depression and his father, fit's the bill.

&gt;http://feministing.com/2011/03/18/new-study-finds-that-men-suffer-postpartum-depression-too/

Fits the bill.

Trans:

&gt;http://feministing.com/2011/09/02/review-of-brown-boi-projects-new-health-guide-freeing-ourselves/

Really interesting article.

&gt;http://feministing.com/2009/11/21/ask-professor-foxy-as-a-trans-man-how-do-i-meet-gay-men/

Romantic advice for a trans man.

Soldiers:

&gt;http://feministing.com/2013/11/11/daily-feminist-cheat-sheet-veterans-day-edition/

Fits the bill, but appears to have gone unnoticed with zero comments.

The rest of the articles also appear to fit the bill (especially the masculinity ones).

Thanks a lot for these articles. I guess my retort would be that these articles aren't exactly the norm, within feminists standards, and that even on these sites, a lot of them didn't achieve a lot of attention. I'm not sure how convincing this is that men don't need their own movement, given that almost a third of the articles you listed didn't really address male issues, a few of them were a stretch to say that they do, and the others, whilst interesting, weren't really at the forefront.

&gt; The only narrative in the main stream media is how bad black people have it right now.

It's supposed to be shining a light on how yes, we're supposed to be treating all races/genders/classes equally, but we're not 100% there yet. Minorities aren't doing as well as whites and thus makes them the underdogs, it's just not as fun to cheer for the fighters with the clear upper hand, and it's insulting to say they don't and indicates a lack of perspective, the only thing that qualifies you to even speak on the subject. So in the case of your friend I assume he did something heinous to get taken down because white people tend to get the benefit of the doubt, in short I assume he deserved what he got. If he'd been black I might assume he was just looking unkempt and the cops thought he was a homeless guy and tackled him, same thing if he was hispanic. If he'd been Asian, they would've escorted him to his dorm room and given him a stern lecture. In any case it's not fair or equal treatment, but if anything they should have all been given the lecture rather than tackled, equality doesn't mean having to result to the lowest common denominator.

<black, targetted>
&gt;Lol wut? We are talking about Baltimore right?

You are. You don't seem to realize that this thread is about Ferguson (which is not in Baltimore) or that I am speaking about riots generally.

&gt;This has always been a race issue but you already know that.

Because poor white and hispanic people don't get harassed by police. 

&gt;Stop with the ad hominems. There's no excuse why Baltimore's 63% black population has made zero progress in the past ten years given the facts I just told you previously. Refute that.

How about you actually put up a point that isn't garbled nonsense? Baltimore elected democrats therefore racial equality achieved? Yeah, QED black people. Racism is extinct in Baltimore. Because, Democrats always act within the interests of the oppressed people, right? Clinton's expansion of the private prison system and cuts to welfare benefited poor people, right? Elected officials always have the means to follow through with their promises right? Which is why Guantanamo no longer exists.

&gt;Stop with the ad hominems.

Google what that means before you misuse it again.

&gt;Stop with the ad hominems, it only shows that you can't back up your points.


Try turning out a point that isn't garbled nonsense. Or try reading the title of the thread.

<black,targetted>
Now these are my views, they could very well not be correct, but i have backed them up with why I feel that way. I believe I answered all of your questions and it took some time. Please do me a favor and do not just pick a minuscule detail out, quote it, and act like the whole section no longer has validity. If you are going to rebuttal or ask more questions at least give me your reasoning as to why you feel that way. I'm well aware I am not going to change anyone on Reddit view but do enjoy discussion not arguments as I do learn from them. So if you don't agree with a response please let me know why you feel a different way. If you don't agree but have do response just tell me. I honestly do not think either of us will jump ship but maybe we could take some valid points back about my the other side feels the way they do.


&gt; you should also explain why anyone would vote for a party whose members accuse them of being too lazy and/or stupid to vote their way?

 I don't think anyone accuse black people of being lazy or dumb, maybe some poor people get called out but 98% of black voters aren't  poor. Only 20% live at or below the poverty line. You relate all black people to being poor, not republicans.

&gt; Tell me why when the problems of minority communities are boiled down to the actions of a minority or people within those communities and the root causes of these problems are glossed over?

500 homicides in LA last year 450 of them were minority on minority. Man assaults a cop and gets shot. Public riots Obama sends aids to the funeral, turns out the witness lied in their testimony. Cop is judged innocent. People riot. 13% of the populations has only 1000 less "drug dealing" not using, arrests than 75% 20k(white) vs 19k (black). Only one minority in pop culture promotes hatred for cops, gang life, violence against other gangs, selling drugs but not doing drugs except weed.  You see plenty of kids who aren't in the bloods or crips, walking around wearing blue and white or red and black. You don't see white kids dressing like skin heads if they are not racist. 

&gt; Why when talking about racism is considered race baiting, but accusing people of only voting for Obama because he's black is not?

Well race baiting continues to promote the idea that its not your fault, the fault lies with white people. The over whelming voter turn out for Obama with a 11% swing seen in young white voters and a 8% increase in black voters with a 98% democratic vote for a candidate with minimal experience and previously a law teacher basically says I am voting for you for something other then your qualifications. So voting for Obama could technically be seen as racist. Observing the data and making that assumption is not racist though.

&gt; Why do conservatives think health care and college are a privilege and then oppose increasing the minimum wage while telling people they need to go to college if they want a better life?

College is not a privilege its a choice, there are plenty of scholarships available, tuition assistance, and loans available. It is actually easier to get into college if you are a minority and there is more aid available. You do not need college to be successful, you can work pretty high up a company ladder without one, or at least to the point where you could afford one. A college degree is nothing more than a piece of paper that said I did it. Aside from certain professions a college degree teaches you zip and it is required as a way to set you apart as a way to weed out people who didn't believe in themselves enough to take the risk of getting student loans without the promise of a degree or have found a way to make it work without making excuses about why they couldn't. Increasing minimum wage will only hurt smaller companies or people making anything under 15/hr whose job can be replaced with a touch screen, larger companies can take the hit and buy automated cash registers, chilis is already doing it for servers. 

Incorporating a healthcare system which was not completely thought out after obama already made a bad investment in the automotive industry is a bad idea. Democrats blame republicans for debt but all Obama has done is created debt.

&gt; Who is scoring political points off of making lists of what the poor can and cannot buy with food stamps? Who thinks it's a good use of tax money to drug test welfare recipients?

Why is making sure your money is not being abused by the people who are using it a bad idea? 11% of the budget is allotted to welfare services (that does not included obamacare and SS which combine account for 50% of the spend) but we demonize defense spending which is only 7% more (18% total) when the military actually provides people who do and don't have college degrees jobs?

&gt; Who really benefits from minorities being dependent?

The political party that makes false promise to dependent people

&gt; tell me how liberals benefit from minorities being dependent?

Liberals benefit from dependents, that's most of their vote. But minorities aren't dependent at most 25% of any minority is dependent, that is what is racist about referring to them as a whole. Liberals want minorities voting together. If you're only talking about help the poor out you are getting significantly less votes. If you talk about helping the poor and the black and Hispanic people. you have now just pulled in the other 75% of those groups to vote lib.

&gt; no one got free stuff for voting for Obama

Look like liberals want to keep them dependent

&gt; this country is significantly less Socialist than it was under FDR and not much, if at all, more than it was under Bush II. (And no, Obamacare isn't Socialism.)

FDR did not hold current rep views and his economy was saved by a war. With bush your relating socialism (economy) to being authoritarian (power government has over citizens). Authoritarian bush was, but not much more than Obama, he definitely did not have a socialist economy.

Yes, indeed, blacks kill blacks, and, furthermore, blacks can be racist against blacks. 

Somehow this circle jerk comments section has missed the point about systemic racism, police militarization, poverty, segregation, social immobility, inequality and oppression having nothing to do with who is pulling the trigger. Hence the SYSTEMIC part. 

We already knew hate, corruption, violence, prejudice and etc. span across all of the races.

I work in inner city hospitals and I can tell you, America is a third world country. Even our nurses comment on how they are one paycheck away from being homeless. 

Own it America, this is what you are. This and worse....

To be fair to the cop, Terrence Jones corroborated half of the cop's account by admitting to yelling at the homeless man to "wake up" and then "nudging" him.

What people don't get about white privilege is it isn't about *them*. It's about people who are disadvantaged. When they look at themselves they think "hey, I've done nothing wrong. I should not feel bad" when in reality what they should be saying is, "oh, that person is having a hard time, I should *empathize* with them!"

It's true I've never done a bad thing to a person of colour in my life. I live in Mississauga Canada where the majority of people I come in contact with during school are people of colour and so most of my friends are, you guessed it, people of colour. But I don't need to have done anything wrong in order to look and see them struggling to do things that I take for granted. I don't need to be a bad person just cause I'm privileged. They are thinking about themselves, that's their issue in a nut shell, they can't see past "I'm doing right" or "I'm doing wrong." They can't see that even though *one person* might be doing the right thing, the vast majority of society *isn't* and *they think they are*.

I have white privilege, I don't want to kill white people, I'm not a monster, I just look at people suffering and in pain and feel their pain a little too. I feel the pain of black families who's son was murdered unjustly by the police in large part because of the colour of his skin. I feel the pain of black youth who have a harder time finding job. Asian people who face stigma if they aren't a genius. Islamic people being harrassed for being born into the culture they were born into. I feel their pain because I look beyond myself, and see their pain, and so feeling their pain is a natural instinct. Mirror Neurons make empathy easy if they would just *look* past themselves.

Yes and no.  One of the issues that certainly needs to be addressed is the police brutality, but to make that the only focus of the protests and the only outcome we are looking for would be a wasted opportunity.  If that is the only thing addressed the larger issues of systemic racism in the police force, justice system, schools and city services will be ignored.  These along with the heroin epidemic and joblessness are the issues that indirectly lead to inner city black men killing each other.  When the white L gets trash cans on the sidewalks that are picked up daily, maintained roads, half way decent schools, bike lanes, a free bus route, street sweeping, tree trimming and maintained park benches while the rest of Baltimore is left to its own devices the people begin to feel like embattled refugees in their own city.  The best of the ignored neighborhoods have associations and not for profits that take care of a lot of these things without the cities help but it is a struggle.  The worst of these neighborhoods look like third world countries full of zombies.  Police give poor people parking tickets that when not paid eventually lead to seizure of those cars which leads to job loss and more poverty.  People get arrested for looking at cops the wrong way and end up unable to get jobs which leads to more poverty.  As long as this cycle continues people will continue to get mad and revolt over some injustice or another that just lights the powder keg that lies under our society in every city in this nation.  These issues need to be addressed nationally.  There was reform in Ferguson within their police department after the report showed systemic racism and civil rights abuses.  Why was there not a further investigation at that point of all police departments in the nation?  They all have the exact same problems.  We can't continue to be reactionary, the cost in blood and treasure is too high.  We need to use this opportunity to initiate real changes in policies to fix these problems once and for all.

sorry for the rant...

<black,targetted>
In my opinion it is only that race is tied to class. Black people make up a disproportionately high percent of the lower class, so any policies that are anti-low class are going to be perceived as racist. Without that perception protests would manifest differently, and responses from other class would be different. Instead we have increasing antagonisms from them, as in the video, and from middle-america as seen in this thread. 

Those more "progressive' than me would also throw in cultural aspects, which lead to black people getting hired less, or police targeting and the like. I think it is enough to point out the statistics of class/race overlap.

<black,targetted>
right completely agree. I am pointing to the coalitions in the article that mention it doesn't matter if his hands were up or not. It absolutely matters, since a movement is being started on that fact. There are two movements that seem to be starting from this. One that is making the point that you are, and one that is saying that cops are killing black kids for no reason. the article is named "Ferguson Report Puts 'Hands Up' to Reality Test", not  about the fines they unjustly give. I was commenting on that, not on the revenue sources coming from disproportional targeting of low-income persons.

Racism exists all over the planet, hard to get rid of something that depends highly on stupidity and last I checked there are plenty of dumb people out there, so if anybody wishes to get rid of that funny after school activity then I'll gladly shit on your dreams and tell you it ain't happening. 

Moreover, if you want to get technical, then all of you smartasses are indeed correct: racism can't exist because human beings don't have races, but that is too scientific for you simple folks, so lets ignore that for now. 

Anyhow...

The following is just a general pro tip about police officers in the States. Police can be racist and some even are but that is by no means a rule. Thing is though they certainly are all racial profiling because that is what they are trained to do, which, by the way, is a must if you want to actually be successful officer of the law. 

Reason why they are racial profiling is not that they are after black people, but instead they are after poor people and my god are black people perfect candidates of the poor class. 

Profiling in general is not peculiar States phenomenon but rather worldwide police standard operating procedure where the poor are the target as they are statistically likely to commit a crime because the alternative would be death (thank the maker for such a fabulous artificial social construct).

States' police officers ought to consider themselves lucky as they can easily identify a black dude, imagine a country where 'alleged' criminals look all the same with the 'honest' citizens - the nightmare, but that is the living hell lots of European countries have to deal with on daily basis, luckily, racial profiling is not the only tool at their arsenal, so bias is still very much real. There is a reason why professional criminals dress well you know, very good reason.

&gt; That said, I think the biggest sign is the number of minorities arrested for crimes compared to whites (for the same crime). 1|2

The biggest sign of what? That cops are racist or that minorities commit crimes at higher rates?

&gt;The unfairness doesn't lie with the sentencing disparity by race for the crime, but that a crime that is primarily committed by blacks while a crime that is effectively the same thing and is primarily committed by whites has more lenient sentences.

I certainly understand this argument. It's very common. It's also very commonly used to conclude that whites somehow were devious and decided to create a law that punishes blacks more than whites... which is a dubious and false claim in many respects, in my opinion.

&gt;Here's a hypothetical. Let's say a law is passed that imposes fines to people who wear their pants too far in either direction (think urban hoodlum or grandpa). It would make sense, that black/ minority youths would be higher represented among those who illegally wear their pants lower, and that the elderly would similarly be over represented among those who wear them too high. Now imagine you make the fine more severe for the people who wear their pants too high. This is effectively what is happening to blacks when it comes to crack cocaine.

Now imagine that the group that got together and created this law were the men and women who live in inner-ciities, are employed, go to church, are predominately minority, and in general have decided to try and enact this law because the people who are walking around with baggy pants are the ones who are committing crimes and making the neighborhood worse...

&gt;I think the white cocaine users from The Wolf of Wall Street should have the same sentences as the homeless guy on the south side of Chicago if the crimes are essentially the same.

I agree... although I didn't see the movie.

Whatsmore - I would make the same for Meth. But if I did that... and then I pointed to the drastically higher number of whites who get busted making meth... does it make the law somehow racist toward whites?

&gt;Here's a link to his Howard Speech.

Yeah, I had read that one before. It was why I challanged the original "He didn't think that through" comment. Rand thought this all through a long time ago.

&gt;I hope he performs like his dad did

To be frank, I hope he doesn't. I do hope he can rally his dad's supporters and get them to work for the GOP! But I think his dad had always pushed himself too far out on the edges to get ellected - even though I liked a lot of his ideas.

The GOP **needed** the Ron Paul supporters. And they **need** them still. It is their youth base and their get-out-the-vote base.

&gt;While it would be nice if they would just fall in line behind Paul if he were to be nominated/elected, I honestly don't see that happening.

I never saw the DNC getting in line behind a nobody senator over Hillary either...

&gt; You claim not to be supremacists. What are your solutions to improving society for everyone that does not involved hatred, inequality, discrimination, or violence?

Multiple ways to achieve that. Segregation or reparation are one: blacks seem to not want to integrate, so leaving their destiny in their hands away from us is one possible solution.

They could also start "acting white" and promoting "white things" like families, jobs, and dressing like civilized members of society. Unfortunately, it feels like the few blacks that do so (Thomas Sowell, Jonathan Gentry, etc) cannot convince the rest to do so. It's been centuries and decades since slavery ended and the civil rights movement radically changed society, and yet they seem to be, as a group, unable to function as members of society despite welfare and social programs. Meanwhile, Miguel, Juan, and Gomez cross the border with only the clothes on their back, and can be seen outside Home Depot looking for an actual job.

I favor repatriating blacks to Africa, but would give blacks without criminal records and with jobs a choice in the matter. All on welfare, drug addictions, protesting the police, or criminal records can go back home. They don't like it here much, apparently, so maybe they would prefer to be in their homelands.

Inequality and violence are necessary for civilization. Violence is needed to counter violence -- hence why police have guns,  countries have militaries, and courts have death penalties. Inequality is fundamental because individuals and groups are not equal to one another, and no amount of social engineering can change that.

They are arrested and prosecuted more for the same crimes as their white counterparts as well as recieveing stiffer sentences for the same crimes.  Bail is set higher amd more often for young black men, and police are more likely to is force against a minority than against whites.  Couple that with the generally violent and unassailable inequity in the cultures of incarceration and law enforcement and add in that shows like cops are compiled as a calculated media strategy to expose poor people and minorities as lesser humans and you get an environment fertile for the growth of  bigotry and perceptual biases.

The media sells world views, as long as your buying them.

&gt; there is a larger percentage of black people that are poor, but given how many more white people there are in the USA, the majority of poor people are white. Thanks for everyone who didn't jump on the hate bandwagon. Was an interesting discussion and I learned something.

I appreciate you taking in the facts but it still bothers me from the get go.  It's already common knowledge that blacks are discriminated against in the justice system and by police......but yet far too many people keep ignoring the facts because they don't believe racism still exist. The only time they will change their view is if someone provides them some proof that can't be refuted. 

As a minority myself I don't need to see the evidence to already believe that minorities are treated differently --- I get to experience it or see it experienced through friends and family. Sure, I want to see the facts that show the discrimination but I"m not going to have the attitude that "it doesn't exist unless you can prove it to me".

&gt;Got any videos of any other ethnicities being murder by the police for their skin color?

There are many. Police brutality in America is a problem for everyone in your country.

&gt;Or how about those ethnicities being forced Into slave labor. Never mind the countless years of systematic oppression black people face it must be the color of their skin that causes them to act this way, sure that's it.

The irish were slaves, they are white. The jews were slaves, they were white. In fact, most races have histories of being in slavery.

The problem is that that age is long gone. It's over, we live in a new world and what we're seeing is a group of poor people blaming their current problems on things that happened in the past. They are holding onto hate, using it to justify their means, and then feeling validated when people start hating them for it. That's when they get to shout "See! racism i'm being oppressed!"

It's time for everyone in your country to smarten the fuck up and act like men.

Well he has a point, to an extent. I don't think it's racist to say there's an issue with how much crime is being committed by black people. It's racist to say they commit more crime just because they're black, but there is something wrong here. I think much of it is because of how black people are treated, by our government and by police and by society in general, but you're fooling yourself if you think the culture low-income black people grow up in isn't damaging. It's such a sensitive subject because even suggesting that low-income black culture is often negative gets you labeled a racist.

First of all: Wat.
Second off, the ARRESTS are also a problem. 50% of the prison population, 13% of the population. Unless blacks are systematically disadvantaged and that 
A) leads them to commit crime and
B) Involves police racism
Then the only logical thing to conclude is that blacks are naturally predisposed to crime. That's obviously bullshit, so systematic racism must be the cause.

Yeah, I have black friends too. I thought that was supposed to be a racist thing to say? Hard to keep up these days.

Everyone knows why poor black neighbourhoods are in the state they're in, high school history is mandatory. I'm asking what does whitey being evil have to do with any of it? How does having no stable family unit translate into "oppression by whites"? Not to mention the ridiculous notion that poor, parentless black kids represent blacks in America as a whole. Almost every successful black person I know can't stand this victimizing nonsense being forced onto them.

Some people realize they're in a shitty position and work hard to get themselves out of it, others sit around feel sorry for themselves and do nothing.

Nice link but we all know racial profiling exists thanks to crime stats. It's shitty but what are white people supposed to do about the stats? We could all get behind holding cops more accountable but it seems people only care when it's white cop, black victim and they can make it into a race thing.

You bring up all this shit as if it's somehow planned by/for white people rather than just poor people being poor and doing nothing to help themselves.

Really curious though, what would you suggest be done to alleviate the problem? Let's say you have unlimited power, whatever you say goes.

<black,targetted>
You are yet again going way outside the scope of the discussion. Do poor people commit more crimes? Yes. Are there more poor black people? Also yes. Does that mean police target blacks more harshly? No. Police look for the person that committed the crime, not the black person that they can most readily pin the crime on. They also don't randomly beat blacks and leave whites alone. The brutality cases are proportionate to the numbers of people in each category (race, gender).

There is certainly a systemic problem of poverty along the black community that has many many causes, some of which are self inflicted. That is an entirely different discussion than what OP was asking though.

My point actually had nothing to do with guns origionally. The point is that when one white cop shoots a dark skinned civilian it is instantly a race thing. If a dark skinned cop shoots a white person, just another guy who was doing something to get shot by a cop.

A lot of the "race killings" were actually just the cops stopping a dangerous person, regardless of race. It's the fact that media and others immediatly jump to "They did it because the 'kid' was black". Except that the 'kid' was 18, 200+ pounds and physically attacked a police officer. That information gets pushed to the wayside because the group of people that identify racialy with the deceased MAKE it a racial issue when it had nothing to do with it before.

Also, before you go nuts on the "most cops are white and kill black people". A lot of cops are white, and black, and hispanic, ect. It really depends on the area you live in and the demographic of the skin color vs. wage earnings in that area. If you have a large lower class that has a majority of dark skinned people and the middle class is predomintly white then you will see more white cops kill dark skinned thugs. That is the case because low class wages generally = more crime in youth.

In answer to your crudeness, there's a saying, "You can drive Nature out with a pitchfork, and yet she will return."

*The Color of Crime* has a segment on Poverty and Crime:
 &gt; Many people believe that a bad social environment is a major contributor to crime. They believe that if people of all races had the same education,income, and social status, there would be no race differences in crime rates. Academic research, however, shows that these differences persist even after controlling for social variables. Figures 14 through 17 show correlations for the 50 states and Washington, DC, between rates of violent crime reported to the police in 2002 and different social factors. In all the charts, the highest point is Washington, DC. A positive correlation can vary from zero to one, and the steeper the trend line, the higher the correlation and the stronger the association. The graph with the steepest trend line and highest correlation, Figure 14, compares violent crime rates to the percentage of the population that is black and Hispanic. The other graphs show that there are relationships between violent crime and other social factors, but the correlations are much weaker. In fact, the percentage of the population that is black and Hispanic accounts for crime rates more than four times better than the next best measure: lack of education. Furthermore, even controlling for all three measures of social disadvantage hardly changes the correlation between racial mix and crime rates. The correlation between violent crime and the percentage of the population that is black and Hispanic is 0.78 even when poverty, education, and unemployment are controlled, versus 0.81 when they are not. In layman’s terms, the statistical results suggest that even if whites were just as disadvantaged as blacks and Hispanics the association between race and violent crime would still be almost as great. It may seem harsh to state it so plainly, but the single best indicator of an area’s violent crime rate is its racial/ethnic mix.

Looking further into a source for the segment:
&gt; Also, while descriptive data show that percentage black is positively and strongly correlated with rates of violence, multivariate research has yielded conflicting findings; some studies report a sharply attenuated effect of race once other factors are controlled, whereas others report that the percentage black effect remains strong (Sampson and Lauritsen 1994, pp. 53-54).

In other areas, like educational achievement, blacks do worse than whites even when you take into account 'socio-economic status.'
&gt; Blacks from families with incomes of more than $100,000 had a mean SAT score that was 85 points below the mean score for whites from all income levels, 139 points below the mean score of whites from families at the same income level, and 10 points below the average score of white students from families whose income was less than $10,000.

Most importantly, the notion that all races are equal does not sync with how we know evolution works. The races became distinguishable after long periods of separation in different environments. The genes underlying intelligence and psychology could not be expected to be evenly distributed among all peoples of the world. Really, people who deny the influence of genetic heritage in the form of race are the modern day equivalent of the geo-centric persecutors of Galileo.

Thing is that the industry didn't cause the collapse, the blacks did through their riots. Quick History:

&gt;The summer of 1967 saw five days of riots in Detroit. Over the period of five days, forty-three people died, of whom 33 were black and 10 white. There were 467 injured: 182 civilians, 167 Detroit police officers, 83 Detroit firefighters, 17 National Guard troops, 16 State Police officers, and three U.S. Army soldiers.

&gt;2,509 stores were looted or burned, 388 families were rendered homeless or displaced, and 412 buildings were burned or damaged enough to be demolished. Dollar losses from arson and looting ranged from $40 million to $80 million.

&gt;**Economic and social fallout of the 1967 riots**  
&gt; After the riots, thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods, and the affected district lay in ruins for decades.  

&gt;Of the 1967 riots, politician Coleman Young, Detroit's first black mayor, wrote in 1994:

&gt;The heaviest casualty, however, was the city. Detroit's losses went a hell of a lot deeper than the immediate toll of lives and buildings. **The riot put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation, mugging the city and making off with incalculable value in jobs, earnings taxes, corporate taxes, retail dollars, sales taxes, mortgages, interest, property taxes, development dollars, investment dollars, tourism dollars, and plain damn money. The money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the white people who fled as fast as they could.** The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterwards it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosion—the outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand. In 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand, followed by forty-six thousand in 1969.

&gt;According to the economist Thomas Sowell:

&gt;**Before the ghetto riot of 1967, Detroit's black population had the highest rate of home-ownership of any black urban population in the country, and their unemployment rate was just 3.4 percent.** It was not despair that fueled the riot. **It was the riot which marked the beginning of the decline of Detroit to its current state of despair.** Detroit's population today is only half of what it once was, and **its most productive people have been the ones who fled.** [Note: In Origins of the Urban Crisis, Thomas Sugrue states that over 20% of Detroit's adult black population in the 1950s and 1960s was out of work, along with 30% of black youth between eighteen and twenty-four]

&gt;Economist Edward L. Glaeser believes the riots were a symptom of the city's already downward trajectory:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Detroit

The industry argument is just a small part of what went to shit, the blacks ruined Detroit and there's no way around that fact. Even with one eye open while the other one is closed to cater for the PC excuses it's evident, the blacks ruined Detroit, no one else.

&gt; does not work because the evidence is a **cop's word against a civilian's.**

Exactly. So what you're saying is the issue is systematic and not racially based. That anyone who is poor and legally without counsel is at risk of being abused by the system.

The problem with issues involving black people getting shot by cops is they like to watch everyone bicker back and forth at one another. 

"Cop 1: Fuck, frank. Another black kid got shot by one of our boys. What do we do?"

Frank: "No worries. The media will have them bickering back and forth for the next year or two. We're fine"

The issue is, whenever a situation like this goes down we always brand it a race issue and never a citizen issue. People getting shot by cops is a problem for everyone who walks the streets. That isn't a race issue that is an American issue.

But no, we need marches and prayer circles and black church leaders to tell us "the fight is not over". 

Meanwhile instead of going after the infrastructures in place they brand white society as a whole as being partially responsible for what went down.

The issue is systematic and unless we change the system from the inside they will keep killing people both white and black and Asian and Hispanic and mentally ill and homeless and so on.

In Baltimore, Maryland, USA, resisting arrest all by itself is  a pretty common charge.  If you are argue or debate with a police officer in Maryland, especially Baltimore and Prince George's County, and they don't feel like talking with you, they will arrest you for resisting arrest.  It seems like it is used in where a disorderly conduct charge would be obviously thrown out.  The resisting arrest charge is so broad they can justify it in nearly any case, even if you hadn't committed a crime to be arrested for.

We have a lot of poor people and minorities in Baltimore, this stuff is mainly used on them.  If you are white and appear well-to-do here, you can get away with pretty much anything.  When I first moved to Baltimore a few years back, the city police arrested something like 85,000 young black men that summer - without charges.  (they would roll down the street with a paddy wagon, and if you were under 25 and black, you would get scooped up and put in jail overnight, then released the next day without charges).  The thousands who protested or argued this would be charged with "resisting arrest" and they would be kept in jail for 3-4 days, then usually the charges would be dropped.

Seems strange, but it was quite the popular program in Maryland.  O'Malley instituted it when he became mayor, and crime plummeted in the city.  The mass arrests finally ended when he left to become governor, but even today, most Marylanders who weren't arrested don't have a problem with the program.  "Something had to be done".

his argument isn't valid. It ignores the racism by the police, the racism by employers, the racism by government that have for the past two centuries kept black people predominantly in the lower class. The movie shows how easy it is to blame black people and adopt a neo-nazi look on things, which is interesting, because it's precisely what's happening to you right now. You're blaming a group of people, who have been shoved down to the lower class for decades for being in the lower class.

&gt;not the underlying causes of racism in the US.

Of course. You can't kill an idea. That's literally impossible. Wasting time and legislating trying to do so would be retarded.

&gt;What do you suggest as a better alternative?

Alternative to the CRA? Removing all governmental (and government enforced) preference for any and all people.

&gt;but I don't see what it has to do with Democrats.

First you must recognize that democrats and republicans share the same policies and platform. As such, Democrat stances on drugs (and terrorism, and finance, and everything else) essentially mirrors Republican stances on issues. So saying "oh it was reagan and bush" doesn't really mean much, since they're all batting for the same team (The US Federal Government)

http://www.hightimes.com/read/president-obama-just-renewed-drug-war

&gt;How do you see gun control as racist?

Creates harsh punishments for black who live in disadvantaged areas (ghettos, essentially) where guns are strictly illegal. Detroit and Washington DC are some of the worst ghettos in the US, and gun control is very tight there and areas like them. So essentially, you're punishing people who need protection the most. These are people who, again due to government setting up their disadvantage almost from birth, require a gun to protect themselves. So basically, the government is putting them in the ghettos, taking away police, and then has the nerve to arrest these people for wanting to protect themselves with personal arms.

&gt;Your assertion that Obama was elected based on the color of his skin and not the content of his character and policies is, itself, an almost laughably racist position, and makes me question the sincerity of anything else you've said.

In both election in which Obama ran, his policies fell directly in line with everything democrats (claim to) hate. On each issue raised during his campaign periods, his stance either mirrored exactly what the republicans were pushing for (especially against Mitt Romney. It was like watching two clones debate each other). That or he just didn't really hold a position or viewpoint at all, hence his completely ridiculous record as a senator.

So when we look at Barack Obama vs. [insert republican], the policies...they match up pretty well on every big issue, from war, to finance, to civil rights. There is no political difference between George W. Bush and Barack Obama (or any other modern day democrat and republican). The only difference, and certainly the only difference that unread and politically unaware people would pick up on is race.

Why do you think people voted for Barack Obama? Do you think it was policy? The same policies that they spent 8 years crying about under Bush?

&gt;So, that said, what are your ideas for addressing the oppression of black people?

Simple. Minimize and eliminate all governmental measures of preferential treatment of all people in the United States.

In Brazil something very similar occurs. However here the levels of death among blacks is actually larger and extremely alarming. What happens here is a systematic persecution and exclusion of the black class that spreads course all the poor and low-income people.

As Dr. Čvorović notes, “In Central and South-Eastern Europe, an average of 46.8 percent of Roma families receive social assistance; 56.8 percent receive child support payments.” In Bulgaria, fully 90 percent of Gypsies live on state benefits. In Britain, their “skillful manipulation of [the] benefits system has brought an outcry from the media, police, and charities for the homeless.”

If he was shot "for being black" as you seem to insist he was, why him?

Why not any one of the millions of other black people in America?

If he was shot for no reason other than the fact he is black, why was he chosen for shooting?

Why not a black homeless person who's shooting would arguably have caused less media attention? Why choose a known celebrity when there are millions of other black people that the police could have chosen, if the sole criteria is "being black"?

exactly. it made the whole anti-brutality, anti-corruption movement pretty much turn to dust. the credibility of everyone involved has been shot. everybody has migrated from the movement except a few ideologues who still cling to the disproven belief that darren wilson is an evil racist who murders just because he hates black people so much. it has (not irreversibly) damaged the movement. i'd say it set the police brutality dialogue back like 10 fucking years honestly... the constant attempts to incite a race war... the media refusing to cover any white victims of police brutality... it makes many white people just stop giving a shit.

if they had covered kelly thomas they would have created actual change. instead, they made the whole thing about race. kelly thomas' brutal murder was **captured on fucking video**. it was OBVIOUS that the officers were guilty of manslaughter at the very least. yet they GOT AWAY with it... they got huuuge pensions for the "disability" of emotional suffering. that's right. emotional suffering caused by murdering somebody. that comes from the taxpayers of fullerton. hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money for murdering a homeless man.

that would have been an extremely credible case for this movement, but instead they focused on a thug. that is pretty solid proof that the media doesn't give a fuck about police brutality, they just wanted to use this for their own ends. the kelly thomas trial wasn't as big of a draw because it didn't involve racism. it just involved absolutely despicable cruelty. if everybody knew kelly thomas' name like they know mike brown's, we would have gotten something done. instead we're stuck with this. the people who still care about police brutality are racist SJWs and idiots. the people who don't care about police brutality anymore are the ones who can actually make a difference. and that's really all because of race baiting. i can't blame it on anything else. i can't think of any other reason why there was not extreme outrage at kelly thomas' murderers being acquitted, why most people don't even know his name. the only explanation is that the media only uses police brutality to incite race tensions. it's just a tool.

That is exactly a main component in this issue. No one but a few idiots and edgy teenagers think ALL blacks are animals, but people need to realize that there IS a toxic, destructive culture among lower class black communities, and they live in a completely different world. They're not going to give a shit that a bunch of SJWs are defending them on the internet. What we need to do as blacks, whites, Mexicans, whatever, is stop blaming "the system", stop blaming police, stop blaming everything other than the real problem, and come together to find actual solutions.

&gt;He got accosted and thieved from by government agents, and slapped in the face by a woman. He went to his local governors office and was ignored. Then set himself on fire. 

Yeah I know. The average American doesn't have to deal with that type of thing, nor do they know anyone who deals with that type of thing. 

&gt;I can think of many people in my life who experienced worse than Bouazizi; people who are permanently and physically scarred by their interactions with police, etc. 

Yes, you can. But the average person can't. So how do you expect people to relate to someone killing themselves in response to such abuse? 

&gt;Pretty sure I'll find one if I dig hard enough. 

Sure. Revealing how rare it is that someones life is hard enough that they would be willing to kill themselves to address the problem. 

&gt;And I doubt you've been homeless, much as I doubt you've been poor; meaning I doubt you've grasped just how unpleasant it can be for some people. 

I have no doubt that it's unpleasant. But bad enough to kill yourself to encourage other people to address the problem? No. 

&gt;Wow, such hyperbole. No you fucking retard, the average Tunisian lives much better than your average homeless American. 

You are probably right. 

&gt;I have family members that lived for over a decade in horrid 3rd world conditions, right here in America in the rural Midwest. I know people who will never be normal or happy again because of what they have experienced here. So I suggest you go fuck yourself. 

Yup, so something the average person can't even remotely relate to. Their self immolation would have been labeled as some freak incident and nobody would have paid much attention beyond the initial headlines. That's because the majority of society can't relate.  

&gt;Yes they do, you thick cunt. They frequently attack and humiliate the innocent. 

And yet much of society doesn't view them as innocent. So how the hell do you think lighting yourself on fire is going to make an impact when that person is viewed as being mentally unstable or fanatical? 

&gt;They strip search minors in front of their peers, they rape women on the side of the road, they beat and electrocute anyone who talks back to them, they commit hate crimes against blacks, Mexicans, and homosexuals with frequency; they hold victimless offenders in solitary for days or weeks on end without charge, they actively torture individuals both in jail and in public, and they murder with impunity.

Yes, and when one of those people lights themselves on fire, what do you think happens next? Since most people can't relate to the things you have listed, or don't view them as violations of rights, nothing happens. Maybe calls for some sort of reform, but the state remains intact. And when people aren't getting raped, they continue to be taxed, and you think more people lighting themselves on fire will end taxation? What about regulations? This entire conversation is about bringing out an anacap society, not minarchy that will eventually turn into rampant statism after a few generations. 

&gt;But strapping uncooperative men into chairs, pepper spraying them in the face, and pulling a spit mask over their mouth and nose is just a first world problem, right?

You know as well as I do that if you stopped those things from happening, your first world problems would be revealed, and nothing would be done about them. Most of the first world doesn't deal with that shit, they go to work, they pay their taxes, they bitch about the public schools, the gasoline prices, they don't view the state as the source of the problem. And no amount of people killing themselves will change that.

&gt;The idea is to gain concessions and provoke/exploit civil unrest. I don't expect Americans to become ancaps. 

Unrest which will involve every opportunist Occupy Wallstreet fucktard  stirring up riots and destroying private property and trying to get the government to step in and fix things. The morons outnumber the people who actually understand the problem. It's the same reason why anarchist revolutions ended in disaster and brought about more state intervention. 

&gt;The fucking nerve of you to suggest that I and other ancaps haven't experienced poverty, the incarceration of loved ones, or gang/criminal violence. 

And you are the minority. A minority that the people you want to save don't give a fuck about. It's like ancaps getting involved in OWS protests. They are both anti police, until the police are out of the picture and then the leftists go on their anti capitalist crusade.

&gt;Maybe it's just people like you who can't relate.

Maybe.

&gt; "It really incensed me that this was so one-sided," [a retired police officer] told NJ Advance Media. "I'm all for the First Amendment, believe me. I'm not defending any police officers who are bad, **but you can't lump 900,000 people that work for law enforcement in the same category.**

If she's so incensed about people lumping 900,000 police officers into the same category, imagine how black individuals must feel when they're lumped in with 37,000,000, or Hispanic individuals when they're lumped in with 50,000,000--10 million and 12 million, respectively, if you assume that police only act with prejudice and impunity against blacks and Hispanics under the poverty line.

And if you assume that police act equally bad towards all poor people (e.g., the "underclasses"), that gives us a pool of up to 48 million.

&gt; Lol what advantage does the average black male have that the average white male doesn't?

It depends what your definition of the "average black male" in America is.

You don't prove your point by comparing the black perpetual underclass with the "average" white American and saying "see, blacks are disadvantaged in every way!"-- the only valid comparison is the black perpetual underclass versus the white perpetual underclass.

&gt; I can think of countless advantages associated with being a white male, the least of which is not having to fear police.

Forgetting the "privileged white male" meme, what about all those average black men in police forces across America? Got anything to say about those ones?

Also, how do you reconcile the fact that it's overwhelmingly more likely for Arabs and Iranians and those belonging to the "Middle Eastern" ethnic block to face racism at a far more vitriolic and almost systematic level in America then Black people?

Is it cancelled out because these people aren't exactly known for being poor, in the context of America?

All I know is that you don't have politicians (GOP, mostly) referring to blacks as insidious threats or as some kind of sinister "fifth column" working against America.

&gt;This may be my own logical mistake, but I find it hard to believe any racist is NOT an idiot on some level.

I didn't say that they are not an idiot on some level, I said that racists are not idiots on the most basic level.

People don't say that black people are bad at driving, they don't say that asians are thieves. 

Racism is based upon an observable reality that is misapplied to being an aspect of a person's race rather than their cultural or circumstantial background.

Black people steal more than other races. To extrapolate that to assuming that a random black person you see is a thief is racist, but it's also logical. 

Have you ever lived in an area with socio-economically disadvantaged people? An area with gangs? Have you ever actually dealt with interactions that breed racist assumptions?

I assume not, since it would be hard to come to your assumptions via anything but pampered ignorance.

&gt;The "logic" that racists have isn't that they can only hate people who commit the same crime, but rather that all people of a certain "race" must be equally deplorable.

The logic that racists have is that the actions of a person are influenced by their environment, and that Sylvari have an upbringing that is essentially alien. If Scarlet is the result of this alien upbringing, then why not others?

The reason you think this is "logic" is because it is. It doesn't make logical sense, and this is fine with you because racists use "logic" because they are idiots.

No racist has ever had one person from a race do something and  then see all members of that race as inhibiting those traits. It requires near endless examples, and multiple generations of 'accumulated wisdom'.

If a Liongaurd has to deal with 50 incidents every day, and the most troublesome group are Sylvari, they'll quickly develop an assumed defensiveness, which will in turn antagonize more of that race, which in turn will escalate.

This is racist, but it's also logical. People are influenced by the people they interact with, and races tend to congregate when living close together. There are plenty of racist black police officers, and there were a number of Jewish Nazis- only people who don't understand racism find this shocking.

A random Sylvari working for Scarlet doesn't make sense. Scarlet's army was at most 1/6th Sylvari. And the Sylvari that were there were visually distinct from standard Sylvari with their visable markings, and chosen outfits. But you're fine with that because racists only use "logic" and are idiots.

&gt;No, it's not exactly a deep discourse of racism, but to be fair it's a side dialogue in a spot of LA apparently very few people ever see.

It's what racism is to someone who believes as you do. Someone who has never experienced anything that could actually engender racist thoughts.

Your ability to keep your job is not solely based on the performance of your students, it does have a significant effect but really cant get you fired. As long as you score high on *certain areas of* your CAST evals then you are probably doing well enough for most of your students to pass the exams anyway. People (mainly older teachers and A schools) get really butt hurt over the exams. But for struggling schools and predominantly black/Hispanic schools (Florida) you see streamlined teaching that is producing a large workforce of moldable individuals. When you have a county (like Duval for example) you have to cut the fat and realize that &gt;50% of the population in poor schools will end up working the system and live on welfare. The goal of those schools is to produce a generation of people to work minimum wage in order to receive minimum welfare benefits from taxpayers. 

Keeping duval in mind, the county has taken upon itself to lower the amount of blacks in the penal system. For years now the police have made close to double the annual salary of a teacher (priorities). A county with these issues is going to do what it can with the resources at hand (meaning not much). There is so much pressure to pass students on to the next grade level in order to lower the population in schools each year, that principles will just hand students a grade rather than earning them. That student ends up graduating (which looks good) with no knowledge. Now if the student does not pass, they end up repeating and repeating until eventually they are either too old or drop out before graduation thus resulting in the same out come. What looks better higher graduation rates or higher drop out rates? technically both students end up with the same level of education. A student with a diploma has a better chance of getting off welfare thus benefiting the county in the long run. In a case like this, it is completely justified to have the standardized tests thrown out the window (basically cheating) for the greater good of the county. 

It is a bull shit system. But until a massive overhaul of public opinion is swayed towards the importance of education (votes for more education funding) we are left with generations of a mindless work force/welfare recipients. 

Remember; the smart kids will always prevail and will end up making it where they need to be and help society, its the kids that never had a chance that are going to struggle. And in the grand scheme of our country, what do we care about more ?

[Blacks are over 20 times more likely to be killed by police than whites.](http://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white?utm_source=et&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=dailynewsletter) 

[Blacks go to jail for less and with far greater frequency than whites with comparable crimes.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/30/black-teens-who-commit-a-few-crimes-go-to-jail-as-often-as-white-teens-who-commit-dozens/)

[By a number of other measures, black people in America are the target of a number of unjust police practices.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-quigley/fourteen-examples-of-raci_b_658947.html)

Your google search is true, but it's not the point. More people are killed by cancer than by murder, does that mean we shouldn't be worried about murder? Besides, there's a difference between a normal person on the street and a cop - namely, normal people go to jail when they kill innocent people. Systemic violence against black people and by black people comes from a system where they're disproportionately in poverty, disproportionately jailed and killed by public servants, and when they try to bring up the fact that these things are true, they're pounced on with cries of "WHAT ABOUT BLACK ON BLACK CRIME?!?!" Which A) is awful, is being addressed by leaders of the black community, and is one of the challenges they have to overcome, but B) distracts from the fact that little progress can be made until black people aren't disproportionately put in jail for minor, nonviolent crimes that in the long run only ensures they can't get better employment and keeps them in poverty, and this is where the policies come in. The war on drugs is the biggest one, especially because enforcement for black people and white people are so different. [White people are more likely to sell drugs, but black people are more likely to be arrested for it.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/30/white-people-are-more-likely-to-deal-drugs-but-black-people-are-more-likely-to-get-arrested-for-it/) But policies like stop and frisk or initiatives that allow police to temporarily detain people on their own suspicions, which don't at first glance target blacks, also leads to unconscious bias producing wildly different outcomes. [Black drivers are about 31% more likely to be pulled over by police,](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/) as an example.

This is all, of course, on top of policies that don't produce disproportionate outcomes but do keep people in poverty where they are. Funding schools with property taxes ensures that the places we most need better schools are the places that get the worst schools. Dozens of states get most of their revenue from sales taxes rather than income or property taxes, which disproportionately affect poorer people who have to live paycheck to paycheck. Our prison system is designed as a punishment system, not a rehabilitation system, meaning that poor people (more likely to commit crimes) [tend to get out of jail when they're done more likely to go back than they were going in in the first place,](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-12-Prison-recidivism-rates-hold-steady.htm) which isn't the case elsewhere in the world. Black people tend to be poorer than white people, so these policies perpetuate this sort of thing at a higher rate with them.

Notice, I'm not using trash sources like Gawker or Jezebel or infoplease because these aren't bullshit liberal talking points, they're relatively uncontroversial points that accurately describe our system. I'm also sure there's stuff I'm missing, maybe other people can point them out.

&gt; This whole theory is about a social gender role being forced on men. 

The issue is agreeing that there are social gender roles, but disagreeing as to what the nature of those roles is.

If you posit that men's nature, either socially or genetically, is the root cause then you need to compare to a control group to get an idea whether these things are really true of men or just people in general. The paper tries to look at male victims, but admits it has little data, and mentions female perpetrators as an afterthought.

The overwhelming majority of data has not even looked for female perpetrators and there has been historic opposition to such research on the grounds it would detract from women. So an untested assumption has been built-in to the groundwork of this research.

&gt; Whether you believe that males are more likely to be perpetrators, or you believe that females are not recognized as perpetrators, you are conceding that there is a cultural link between males and rape. 

Except their hypothesis goes way beyond just stating it's a cultural role. If you take a cultural role as the base you can get "teach people not to view men as rapists" about as easily as "teach men not to rape". Accepting culturally created roles doesn't entail accepting the hypothesis of this paper.

We know black people in America are convicted of more theft than white people, we can be pretty sure this isn't genetic by comparing different studies. Some is probably purely economic, some is probably police bias and some is probably cultural. Does this mean "teach black people not to steal" is a good message to send?

&gt; Instead, as you can see in this article I posted, it's about "teaching" men that rape is not biological, despite the messages that they get from society and media and that rape is artificially associated with masculinity. It helps men fight back against the oppressive gender expectations they face and liberate themselves from these stereotypes. Just like feminists "teach" women to liberate themselves from gender stereotypes and roles that they get from society and the media.

This is where the narrative gets so bizarre I start to wonder if I live in the same universe as the people writing these papers. I went to a school were sexual harassment happened if the accuser said it did, period. I think I was 6 the first time I was told "don't you ever rape anyone" after a sexual assault aired on the news. This was directed pointedly at me for no reason I could see and I was incredibly confused as to why anyone would think I would and was basically told "because you're a boy" (I'm actually genderqueer) when I asked. Since before puberty it has been very clear to me that being male-bodied is a socially acceptable reason to assume someone is a predator and thus discriminate against them.

We currently have college faculty saying "it is the responsibility in the case of the male to gain consent before proceeding with sex," in the case of two drunken individuals. Women who have sex with minors, especially boys, do not receive the same kind of treatment as men. Is this because we teach men to rape or is it because we teach people to view women as victims but not men?

&gt; Whether you believe that males are more likely to be perpetrators, or you believe that females are not recognized as perpetrators, you are conceding that there is a cultural link between males and rape.

I think it is relevant. Their hypothesis is not that there are differing perceptions of men and women but that there is a culture that creates a predisposition for males to rape. This is in direct contradiction to the culture I see and by framing rape as a male behaviour, even if culturally induced, it undermines our ability to deal with female perpetrators.

If our culture creates a tendency for poor people to steal that doesn't mean we have a "theft culture" or that society endorses, approves of, or even subtly encourages such action. We shouldn't waste time looking for social messages that reinforce the idea that poor people should steal or try to analyse what "theft myths" exist that justify their behaviour. You can handle the situation with carrot or stick but nobody is going to pretend it's actually culturally supported. 

The majority of the studies referenced have operated under the assumption that this is a male phenomena and in almost all cases have not even gathered the data that could be used to contrast.

I also have a problem with the timing of this moral panic. Much like the moral panic over gun crime it coincides with a massive *drop* in overall rates. Yearly rates have consistently fallen. The crisis is being resolved yet the general attitude is that it just started and is not being dealt with. While lifetime rates remain high they do not necessarily reflect current victimization rates. Yearly rates for men and women are nearly even when made to penetrate is included as rape. http://freethoughtblogs.com/hetpat/2014/09/08/quick-update-on-cdc-sexual-victimisation-stats/#more-631

http://freethoughtblogs.com/hetpat/2013/09/04/the-startling-facts-on-female-sexual-aggression/

"Teach men not to rape" disingenuously implies our current approach is not working and that we currently aren't teach men not to rape. Perhaps worst all the continued focus on what men do and the corrispoding idea that "men can stop rape" says to male victims of female rapists that they don't matter and could have stopped it.
